Photo Galleries

One of the biggest customer complaints about vBulletin 5.X and the change in how addons and plugins are handling is the lack of actual photo galleries. These should be implemented.

1. Create a new "Super Channel" called Photo Gallery (photos or galleries for short.
2. Improve the photos tab to use "card" style layout.
3. Add comments to Photos - As photos are attachments and attachments are nodes, the only hold up here should really be an interface.
