			After your config.php files have been edited and saved it is time to upload the vBulletin scripts to your
			web server. You are now ready for installation.<br>
			<br>
			The uploading process should be familiar to anyone who has published pages to a web site before, but a brief
			description of the process is given here.<br>
			<br>
			Although there are several methods available to transfer the vBulletin files from your computer to your web
			server, by far the most common method in use is transfer via FTP. Most operating systems have built-in tools
			for opening FTP connections although they are often limited in their usefulness and many people opt to use a
			third party FTP client application. For this example we will use <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/"
				target="_blank">FileZilla</a>.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">We do not recommend using the built-in file transfer features in WYSIWYG
					editors such as Adobe Dreamweaver® or Microsoft Expression Studio®. These programs often add
					information to vBulletin's files or do not maintain their structure properly which will cause
					problems while installing or upgrading the software. We also do not recommend using any web-based
					file managers that your hosting service may provide as a solution. For best performance and
					reliability you are recommended to use a stand alone FTP client like Smart FTP or Filezilla.</div>
			</div>
			<font size="3"><strong>Installing in a Sub-Directory</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			The easiest way to transfer the files is to upload the entire <strong>upload</strong> folder to the server.
			Using FileZilla we do this by dragging the <strong>upload</strong> folder from its location on your
			computer's hard disk to the web publishing folder on the server.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/1.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			Most FTP client applications will handle the file transfers automatically, but if for some reason your
			application does not, you should make a note of the following:<ul>
				<li><strong>All text files to be transferred in ASCII mode</strong><br>
					All files containing plain text from the vBulletin package should be transferred in ASCII mode.<br>
					Text file types you will find in vBulletin are: <em>.html, .php, .js, .xml, .css.</em></li>
				<li><strong>All non-text files to be transferred in Binary mode</strong><br>
					The remaining files, which are mostly images, should be transferred to your web server in binary
					mode.<br>
					Binary file types used in vBulletin are: <em>.gif, .png, .jpg, .ico.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">The web publishing folder is usually called <em>public_html</em>,
					<em>www</em> or <em>htdocs</em> and is located within your home directory. If you are unsure of
					where to find your own web publishing folder, your host will be able to help you.</div>
			</div>Depending upon the speed of your internet connection, uploading all the files could take several
			minutes to complete. After completion, you should see that the web server now contains a folder called
			<strong>upload</strong> containing a perfect copy of the files in the <strong>upload</strong> folder on your
			computer's hard disk.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/2.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			When all the files have been uploaded successfully you should rename the <strong>upload</strong> folder on
			the web server to the name you want to use for your forums directory. We will be calling it
			<strong>forums</strong> for the purposes of this manual.<br>

			<br>
			<font size="3"><strong>Installing at the Domain Root</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			Alternately, if you’d rather have the installation at the root level of your site, you can upload all the
			files contained in the <strong>upload</strong> folder directly into the web publishing folder on the server.
			This will bring your visitors directly to the vBulletin site when they visit your website.<br>
			<br>
			Using FileZilla we do this by dragging the contents of the <strong>upload</strong> folder from its location
			on your computer's hard disk to the web publishing folder on the server.<br>
