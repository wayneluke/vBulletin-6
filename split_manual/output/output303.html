			An avatar is a small image that users can include in their profile and will be displayed on every post they
			make.<br>
			<br>
			There are two types of avatars, predefined and custom:<ul>
				<li><strong>Predefined avatars</strong> are images that the board administrator has made available to
					use.</li>
				<li><strong>Custom avatars</strong> are images created by the user that can be uploaded to the board if
					the Adminstrator has granted that particular permission.</li>
			</ul>
