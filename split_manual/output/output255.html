			To add a <strong>Multiple-Selection Checkbox</strong> field to the User Profile form, click on the following
			to your left: <span class="Mprocess">User Profile Fields&gt; Add New User Profile Field</span> then select
			<strong>Multiple-Selection Checkbox</strong> from the dropdown menu.<br>
			<br>
			The <strong>Multiple-Selection Checkbox</strong> form allows you to add a custom multiple-selection checkbox
			field to the <strong>User Profile</strong> form.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Title</strong><br>
					The name of your Multiple-Selection Checkbox field.</li>
				<li><strong>Description</strong><br>
					This is the description of the field as shown to your users. You should describe here what the field
					is intended for, and if it is required field or not, and/or if it is private from other users or
					not. If you choose the limit the number of choices, you should also add that information here.</li>
				<li><strong>Profile Field Category</strong><br>
					It is possible to group custom user profile fields into categories so that they can be logically
					grouped. The primary purpose of doing this is to allow different categories to be shown in different
					tabs or blocks on a user's profile page (in addition to being shown in the 'About Me' tab). See the
					<a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_userprofilefields_userprofilefieldcategories"
						class="Mhop">User Profile Field Categories</a> article for more information.</li>
				<li><strong>Limit Selection</strong> <em>Default: 0</em><br>
					Maximum number of options the user may select. Set to <em>0</em> to allow the user to select all
					options.</li>
				<li><strong>Options</strong><br>
					In this box, put each value that should appear as an option. Make sure to separate each option with
					a new line carriage return ("Enter" key).<div class="Mnote">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">You may have a maximum of 31 options in this field.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Display Order</strong><br>
					This sets the order in which fields are displayed. The default is to add it to the end of your
					current fields. Display order starts at 1 and can be any whole positive number (don't use decimals
					or fractions).</li>
				<li><strong>Field Required</strong> <em>Default: No</em>

							profile.</li>
						<li><strong>Yes, always</strong><br>

					for each user.</li>
			</ul><strong>Display Page</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Which page displays this option?</strong> <em>Default: Edit Profile</em><br>
					This controls what page the profile field is displayed on. Most likely you want to leave this on
					"Edit Profile" but if you wish to create your own user options that can be manipulated via template
					conditionals then select "Options". This field will then appear on the "Options" page of the User
					CP. Also, this field will not appear when viewing a user's profile.</li>
			</ul>
