			To get to the <strong>User Title Manager</strong>, click on the following to your left: <span
				class="Mprocess">User Titles&gt; User Title Manager</span>.<br>
			<br>
			The <strong>User Title Manager</strong> allows you to specify user titles based on post count. When a user
			reaches the specified minimum post count their title will be changed. User titles are an indication of
			status on the forums and are displayed below names in posts and in their User Profile. The term 'ladder' is
			used to describe the hierarchy of the titles.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">If a user's usergroup has a user title specified (see the <a
						href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_usergroup_manager"
						class="Mhop">Usergroup Manager</a> article) then that user will have their usergroup's title
					instead of the ladder of titles in the <strong>User Title Manager</strong>.</div>
			</div>The <strong>User Title Manager</strong> displays a table of the user titles based on post count
			available on your site. Above the table is a note that you should update user titles and ranks after adding,
			editing and deleting user titles. Clicking the link in the note takes you to the
			<strong>Maintenance</strong> panel. For more information on this panel, consult the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_maintenance_tools" class="Mhop">Maintenance</a>
			article.<br>
			<br>
			The table displays the User Title, Minimum Posts, and Controls for editing or deleting the user titles.<ul>
				<li>The <strong>User Title</strong> column displays the text entered into the <strong>Title</strong>
					field in the <strong>Add/Edit User Title</strong> form.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Minimum Posts</strong> column displays the text entered into the <strong>Minimum
						Posts</strong> field in the <strong>Add/Edit User Title</strong> form. This is the minimum
					number of posts for a user to receive this title. They will have this title until they make enough
					posts to be moved to the title with the next highest minimum posts value.<div class="Mnote">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">The post count checked against the minimum posts value is the value
							stored with the user. Therefore, posts in forums that do not count posts will not have an
							effect.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>The <strong>Controls</strong> column contains a dropdown with two options: one to edit and one to
					delete the corresponding user title.<br>
					<br>
					Choosing the <strong>Edit</strong> option will open the <strong>Add/Edit User Title</strong> form
					for the corresponding title.<br>
					<br>
					Choosing the <strong>Delete</strong> option displays a confirmation screen asking if you are sure
					you want to delete the title. Clicking the <strong>No</strong> button will cancel the operation and
					return you to the <strong>User Title Manager</strong>. Clicking the <strong>Yes</strong> button will
					delete the title. This action cannot be undone.</li>
			</ul>Below the table is a <strong>Add New User Title</strong> button. Clicking this button will open a blank
			<strong>Add/Edit User Title</strong> form.
