			As users, gain and lose reputation, they are associated with a moniker that describes their current level.
			These levels are modifiable by navigating to <span class="Mprocess">User Reputations-&gt;User Reputation
				Manager</span>.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;insert image of reputation manager&gt;&gt;</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			In the above example, we have all of the levels that users on this forum can achieve. For example, a user
			with a reputation of 55 would have the level of <em>will become famous soon enough</em>. A user with a
			reputation of -5 would have a level of <em>has a little shameless behaviour in the past</em>. Since the
			lowest level in this example is -99999, any user with a reputation lower than this would use the default
			undefined level that is set in the reputation section of the vBulletin Options.<br>
			<br>
			From this screen you can choose to edit a level description, change a level minimum or remove a level. If
			you wanted to change the minimum level of <em>has a reputation beyond repute</em> from 2000 to 3000 you
			would enter 3000 in the input field where 2000 is currently and press <strong>Update</strong>.<br>
			<br>
			If you wished to change the text of <em>has a reputation beyond repute</em>, you would press the
			<strong>Edit</strong> link.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;insert image of reputation editor&gt;&gt;</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			From this screen you can also change the minimum level as you can from the previous screen. Enter the new
			level text in the <strong>Description</strong> field but take care as you can not use HTML in this field.
			Press <strong>Update</strong> when finished.
