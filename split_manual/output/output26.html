			<strong>After installing, there are no images or CSS in the AdminCP?</strong><br>
			A. Make sure that you're accessing the AdminCP from site/admincp and not site/core/admincp. Also make sure
			that the Site URL setting under Settings -&gt; Options -&gt; Site Name / URL / Contact Details has /core at
			the end of it.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>None of the links work when I click on them on the front end.</strong><br>
			Make sure that you have mod_rewrite (Apache) or URL Rewrite (IIS) enabled on your site. Upload the
			corresponding .htaccess or web.config file found in your upload directory.<br>
			<br>
			If that do not resolve the problem, make sure there are no spaces or hidden characters in your /config.php.
			These can cause PHP errors that confuse the vBulletin Routers and prevent redirects from happening
			correctly.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>My vBulletin is installed in a sub-directory and the .htaccess doesn't work properly. However it
				does work in the parent directory.</strong><br>
			You will need to add a RewriteBase Directive to your .htaccess file. In the .htaccess file find the line
			that says <span class="Mmono">RewriteEngine On</span>. After it place the following line:<br>
			<span class="Mmono">RewriteBase /pathtovbulletin/</span><br>
			<br>
			<span class="Mmono">pathtovbulletin</span> should be the path from your website root or /.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>My hosting provider will not allow mod_rewrite or URL Rewrite to be installed.</strong><br>
			Unfortunately, you will need to find a new hosting provider to continue to use vBulletin.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>What do I do with the old vBulletin 4.X files?</strong><br>
			They should be deleted so they do not provide conflicts with the new system. You will want to maintain the
			directories for your attachments or custom user uploads.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>What if I use a web server other than Apache or IIS?</strong><br>
			We do not currently support other webservers. Please view the <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/forum/"
				target="_blank">community forums</a> as there may be community supplied solutions to other web server
			configurations.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>When I click the Site Home Page in the Admincp, it leads me to a blank page</strong><br>
			You need to access your vBulletin forums from <span class="Mmono">forumroot</span> and <span
				class="Mmono">forumroot/admincp</span>. It should not be accessed via the <span
				class="Mmono">forumroot/core</span> directory except for the installation and upgrade wizards.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>My host requires using mod_fcgid or phpSUExec on my server and vBulletin does not work.</strong><br>
			You can try updating your .htaccess file with the following change:<br>
			<br>
			Find - <br>
			RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]<br>
			<br>
			Change To - <br>
			RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]<br>
			<br>
			<strong>I have Javascript turned off and vBulletin does not work.</strong><br>
			Javascript is required to use vBulletin.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>I can't access Site Builder on my phone.</strong><br>
			This is by design.

			From time to time it will be necessary to upgrade your vBulletin installation to the latest version, either
			to gain new features or to fix newly discovered bugs in PHP, MySQL or vBulletin itself.<br>
			<br>
			You can upgrade to the latest version of vBulletin from the following vBulletin versions:<ul>
				<li>Any version of vBulletin</li>
				<li>Any version of vBulletin 4, from version 4.0.0 Beta 1 to the latest version.</li>
				<li>Any version of vBulletin 3 from version 3.6.0 and newer. If your vBulletin version is older than
					3.8.0, it is recommended that you upgrade to at least vBulletin 3.8.0 before you can upgrade to
					vBulletin.</li>
			</ul>The upgrade process differs depending upon the version of vBulletin currently installed on your web
			server.<br>
			<br>
			When upgrading, the first step is always the same, in that you must log in to the vBulletin Members' Area
			and download the latest vBulletin package available, as described in the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/downloadpackage" class="Mhop">installation
				instructions</a>.<div class="Mwarn">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">We <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you back up your database prior
					to any upgrade. This will allow you to restore your data should anything happen during the upgrade.
					The chance of a catastrophic failure is very remote but it can happen.<br>
					<br>
					A document detailing how to back up your database is available in the <em>Technical Documents</em>
					section of the vBulletin Manual's Appendices, <a
						href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/manual_database_backup" class="Mhop">here</a>.
