			Path to Attachment Manager<span class="Mprocess">Attachments &gt; Attachment Manager</span>.<br>
			<br>
			Using the vBulletin Attachment Manager, you can specify the types of attachments (for example, JPB, GIF, or
			PDF) you want to allow users to upload to your site, the maximum filesize for a given attachment, the
			maximum dimensions for an image attachment, and whether or not as well as how thumbnails can be created from
			full-size images.<br>
			<br>
			When you open the Attachment Manager, you are shown a tabular summary of the currently allowed attachment
			file types and their characteristics.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a level-setting screenshot of the Attachment Manager home screen.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			The form has five columns. Each column displays a piece of information for the extensions. The information
			is as follows:<ul>
				<li><strong>Extension</strong> - the name of the extension</li>
				<li><strong>Maximum File-size</strong> - the maximum file-sized allowed for the named extension </li>
				<li><strong>Max Width</strong> - the maximum width allowed for the named extension if it’s an image</li>
				<li><strong>Max Height</strong> - the maximum height allowed for the named extension if it’s an image
				</li>
				<li><strong>Controls</strong> - the options for editing, deleting, or viewing the permissions on the
					named extensions</li>
			</ul>From the Attachment Manager home screen you can do any of the following tasks:<ul>
				<li>To add a new attachment extension, click the <strong>Add New Extensiont</strong> button at the
					bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>To edit the characteristics of an existing extension, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link in the
					picklist to the right of the filetype name.</li>
				<li>To delete </li>
				<li>To specify usergroup permissions for an extension, click the <strong>View Permisisons</strong> link
					in the picklist to the right of the filetype name.</li>
			</ul>
