			vBulletin's language system allows you to localize your site in languages other than US English without
			editing any templates or files. The vBulletin phrase system makes its templates language independent so you
			can display pages in multiple languages using a single style.<br>
			<br>
			Each phrase (for example, “password” or “one hour ago”) can have a translation for every language specified
			in this Language Manager. When a channel page is loaded, vBulletin checks what language the current
			logged-in user has selected, looks up the phrase variables in that language, and replaces them with the
			appropriate translated text.<br>
			<br>
			In addition to translated phrases, vBulletin's language system supports translated images (by allowing you
			to override a style's images folder setting), and language-specific date/time/number formats.<br>
			<br>
			The topics in this section cover what you need to know to localize your vBulletin site.
