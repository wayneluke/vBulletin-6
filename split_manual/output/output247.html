			vBulletin features a wide array of input options for you to gather information from your members through the
			creation of custom profile fields. With these fields you can present a defined list of options for the user
			to choose from or you can ask the user to give their own input. You can even combine the two options for
			maximum usability.<br>
			<br>
			There are six input options to choose from to tailor your required user profile data collection method.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Single-Line Text Box</strong><br>
			A single-line textbox that allows the user to enter a response.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Multiple-Line Text Box</strong><br>
			A multiple-line textbox.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Single-Selection Radio Buttons</strong><br>
			This option offers the user a choice of multiple answers, allowing them to make one selection.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Single-Selection Menu</strong><br>
			This option offers the user a single choice of multiple answers presented as a dropdown menu.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Multiple-Selection Menu</strong><br>
			This option offers multiple choices to the user, allowing multiple selections to be made from a drop down
			menu plus a selection box.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Multiple-Selection Checkbox</strong><br>
			This option also offers multiple choices to the user, allowing multiple selections to be made from a set of
			checkboxes.<br>
			<br>
			These fields can be required at registration or you can have them be shown after registration via the user's
			profile and options in the <span class="Mprocess">User CP</span>.
