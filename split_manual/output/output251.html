			To add a <strong>Multiple-Line Text Box</strong> field to the User Profile form, click on the following to
			your left: <span class="Mprocess">User Profile Fields&gt; Add New User Profile Field</span> then select
			<strong>Multiple-Line Text Box</strong> from the dropdown menu.<br>
			<br>
			The <strong>Multiple-Line Text Box</strong> form allows you to add a custom multiple line text box field to
			the <strong>User Profile</strong> form.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>
			</div><strong>Add New User Profile Field</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Title</strong><br>
					The name of your Multiple-Line Text Box field.</li>
				<li><strong>Description</strong><br>
					This is the description of the field as shown to your users. You should describe here what the field
					is intended for, and if it is required field or not, and/or if it is private from other users or
					not.</li>
				<li><strong>Profile Field Category</strong><br>
					It is possible to group custom user profile fields into categories so that they can be logically
					grouped. The primary purpose of doing this is to allow different categories to be shown in different
					tabs or blocks on a user's profile page (in addition to being shown in the 'About Me' tab). See the
					<a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_userprofilefields_userprofilefieldcategories"
						class="Mhop">User Profile Field Categories</a> article for more information.</li>
				<li><strong>Default Value</strong><br>
					If the member doesn't change this field, then this will be the value stored in their profile.</li>
				<li><strong>Max length of allowed user input</strong> <em>Default: 100</em><br>
					The maximum number of characters that the member will be allowed to input.</li>
				<li><strong>Field Length</strong> <em>Default: 25</em><br>
					The width of the input box in characters.</li>
				<li><strong>Text Area Height</strong> <em>Default: 4</em><br>
					This is how many rows high the input should be on the forms. It is recommend that you set this to at
					least 2.</li>
				<li><strong>Display Order</strong><br>
					This sets the order in which fields are displayed. The default is to add it to the end of your
					current fields. Display order starts at 1 and can be any whole positive number (don't use decimals
					or fractions).</li>
				<li><strong>Field Required</strong> <em>Default: No</em>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Yes, at registration and profile updating</strong><br>
							User will be required to complete this field at registration and when updating their
							profile.</li>
						<li><strong>Yes, always</strong><br>
							User will be required to complete this field at registration. Enabling this setting will
							force all users to complete it before they can continue using your forum. This applies only
							if the field is shown on the "Edit Your Details" page.</li>
						<li><strong>No</strong><br>
							Completion of this field is optional.</li>
						<li><strong>No, but display at registration</strong><br>
							Completion of this field is optional but it will appear at registration.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Field Editable by User</strong> <em>Default: Yes</em>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Yes</strong><br>
							User may edit this field at any time.</li>
						<li><strong>No</strong><br>
							User may never edit this field.</li>
						<li><strong>Only at registration</strong><br>
							User may only edit this field at registration or if it is set to be required and it is
							blank.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Private Field</strong> <em>Default: No</em><br>
					If this is set to <em>Yes</em>, this field can be filled in by the user but will only be viewable to
					those with the proper usergroup permission.</li>
				<li><strong>Field Searchable on Members List</strong> <em>Default: Yes</em><br>
					If this is set to <em>No</em>, users will not be able to search using this field on the
					<strong>Member's List Advanced Search</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Regular Expression</strong><br>
					You may require this field's contents to match a PCRE-type regular expression. For example, you
					could have a field that is for the user's ICQ number. Since ICQ numbers consist of only numerals,
					you could write a regular expression to check for non-numerals.<br>
					<br>
					Example:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
						<pre class="Mcodeblock">^[0-9]{7,8}$</pre>
					</div>If you want to allow an empty response to be given, you need to account for it within the
					regex:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
						<pre class="Mcodeblock">^[0-9]{7,8}$|^$</pre>
					</div>See <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php" target="_blank">PHP.net</a>
					for more information on regular expressions.<br>
				</li>
			</ul><strong>Display Page</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Which page displays this option?</strong> <em>Default: Edit Profile</em><br>
					This controls what page the profile field is displayed on. Most likely you want to leave this on
					"Edit Profile" but if you wish to create your own user options that can be manipulated via template
					conditionals then select "Options". This field will then appear on the "Options" page of the User
					CP. Also, this field will not appear when viewing a user's profile.</li>
