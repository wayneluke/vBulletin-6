			If you want to set up your MySQL server to run automatically whenever the system is running (just like your
			Web server probably does), you'll have to set it up to do so. In the share/mysql subdirectory of the MySQL
			directory, you'll find a script called mysql.server that can be added to your system startup routines to do
			this.<br>
			<br>
			Assuming you've set up a special MySQL user to run the MySQL server, you'll need to edit the mysql.server
			script before you use it. Open it in your favorite text editor and change the mysql_daemon_user setting to
			refer to the user you created above:<blockquote class="Mtype">mysql_daemon_user=mysqlusr</blockquote>Setting
			up the script to be run by your system at startup is a highly operating system-dependant task. If you're not
			using RedHat Linux and you're not sure of how to do this, you'd be best to ask someone who knows. In RedHat
			Linux, the following commands (starting in the MySQL directory) will do the trick:<blockquote class="Mtype">
				cp share/mysql/mysql.server /etc/rc.d/init.d/<br>
				cd /etc/rc.d/init.d<br>
				chmod 500 mysql.server<br>
				cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d<br>
				ln -s ../init.d/mysql.server S99mysql<br>
				cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d<br>
				ln -s ../init.d/mysql.server S99mysql</blockquote>That's it! To test that this works, you can reboot
			your system and request the status of the server as before to make sure it runs properly at startup.
