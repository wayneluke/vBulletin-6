			If you’re an Administrator in vBulletin, you might have noticed a new button to the right of your login.
			This button lets you access the Site Builder. The Site Builder lets you create new pages, and add and remove
			modules to existing pages. It also allows you to edit both the header, the footer and the navigation bar.
			Site Builder makes vB5 even more customizable than earlier versions and gives you unparalleled control over
			the content of your site in an easy to use interface.<br>
			<br>
			We’ll show you how. <br>
			<br>
			The first step in customizing pages on your site is to turn Site Builder on. To do that, just click the
			<span class="Mprocess">Off</span> button in the top-right corner of your forum. This reveals a new menu bar
			at the top of the page, like this:<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-01.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			There are five buttons in the new menu bar, New Page, Edit Page, Header, Navigation Bar, and Footer. Each
			option controls and edits a different part of your site. Clicking on a button will open and reveal the
			related forms. <br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-02.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Why don’t we start with the New Page?</strong><br>
			<br>
			Go ahead and click the <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;New Page&#39; button">[New Page]</span>
			button. You’ll notice three tabs in the form. Each tab controls a different aspect of Page Creation. &lt;Add
			Modules&gt; lets you drag and drop new modules onto a page. Once you’ve added a module to a page, you can
			change the placement of the module by dragging and dropping it where you want, edit the functionality, and
			even remove the module. <br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-03.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/sitebuilder_modulelist" class="Mhop">Click here for a list
				of modules and what they do.</a><br>
			<br>
			The &lt;Change Layout&gt; tab, on the other hand, controls how many columns your page has and the width of
			each column. <br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-04.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			The &lt;Select Template&gt; tab allows you to create a page quickly from a saved template. A template is an
			existing page that has all the modules, with the options you selected for them, and the layout you made for
			them that you can use to make your new page. This is especially handy when you’re creating a number of
			similar pages with only small differences.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-05.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally, the &lt;Color Style&gt; tab allows you to control the colors for the page you're creating. You can
			use the color wheel as well as the <strong>My Color Palette</strong> tool to adjust and change the color
			scheme.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-06.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			Now that you’re familiar with the overall function of each tab in the New Page form, you can either try to
			make a page yourself or continue with the tour.<br>
			<br>
			<a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/sitebuilder_addpage" class="Mhop">Check out the Page
				Creation Tutorial</a><br>
			<br>
			We’re going to skip the Edit Page Button and move straight to the Header button. The Edit page has the same
			functionality as the New Page form except that it’s for editing the page that you are currently viewing
			rather than creating a new one. <br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-07.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			The <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Header&#39; button">[Header]</span> button controls the
			header of every page and is divided into two parts. The Site Logo allows you to edit the header image for
			your site. You can upload any image into the space as long as it’s either a .png, .jpg, or .bmp. The Header
			Ad HTML module allows you to add HTML to the header of your site. You’ll usually be using this to place ads
			at the top of your page. For a more complete tutorial on how to do this, <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/sitebuilder_header" class="Mhop">click here</a>.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-08.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			The next button we’re going to look at is the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Navigation&#39; button">[Navigation]</span> button. Once clicked, you will see a
			tool that has two columns, the first controls the main navigation bar. Anything created in this column will
			show up as tabs on your site. You can change the positions of the tabs by dragging and dropping the items to
			the order you desire.<br>
			<br>
			The second column is for sub-navigation items. This means that these navigation items will only show up when
			you have selected the tab that contains them. Like the main navigation items, you can change the position of
			the sub-navigation item in the tab by dragging and dropping it. However, you can’t move a sub-navigation
			item from one tab to another. If you need to have the same sub-navigation on a new tab, you will need to
			recreate it for each tab you want to view it on.<br>
			<br>

			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-09.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			The final button we’ll cover is the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Footer&#39; button">[Footer]</span> button. It’s very similar to the Navigation
			Bar tool except that all the links will appear at the bottom of your page. Unlike the Navigation Bar tool
			you are not allowed to create sub-navigation items.<br>
