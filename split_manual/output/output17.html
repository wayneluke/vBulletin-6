			New in vBulletin is the Presentation configuration file. It is always located in the forum root or /
			directory of your vBulletin package. In a newly unzipped package, this would be the upload folder.<br>
			<br>
			It is named config.php.bkp. Rename this file to config.php by removing the .bkp extension.<br>
			<br>
			This file no longer needs to be edited to perform an installation. It is there for support purposes only.
