			vBulletin has been designed to bring you modern community building and ease of use.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">Site Builder</font>
			</strong><br>
			One of the best new features of vBulletin is Site Builder. Site Builder is a new way to build and manage
			your sites. It features drag and drop technology to enable you to build custom pages that fit your needs
			quickly and easily. Site Builder also includes a Style Generator so you can quickly and easily create a new
			styles with custom color combinations.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">Everything is Content</font>
			</strong><br>
			In vBulletin, we’ve developed an idea that everything is content. This is built around a new content model
			involving channels, nodes and the actual content. In this model everything works the same, everything is
			searchable and everything provides a modern input system. Adding new content should be more intuitive for
			your users.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">New Search</font>
			</strong><br>
			The Search Engine architecture has also been reconfigured so that all content is easily searched. Rewritten
			from the ground up, the new search engine should provide more relevant details and accurate results.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">MVC Architecture</font>
			</strong><br>
			vBulletin introduces a new MVC Architecture designed to separate the business logic from the presentation
			logic more than ever before. This will allow vBulletin to be quickly and easily extended as we bring new
			features to the software.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">Responsive Design</font>
			</strong><br>
			People are using devices of many different sizes these days. These include phones, tablets and ultra-high
			density monitors. We’ve included a responsive design in vBulletin that scales to the device being used. No
			more worrying about mobile styles and trying to configure things for multiple devices. vBulletin adjusts to
			the screen-size of the user’s device automatically.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">Expanded API</font>
			</strong><br>
			The API of vBulletin has been expanded. Not only can mobile apps take advantage of the API, the web
			interface of vBulletin uses it for its own purposes as well. This provides a more structured design and the
			ability to code everything once regardless of how it is accessed.
