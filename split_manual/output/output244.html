			Path to Viewing User Infractions: <span class="Mprocess">User Infractions &gt; View Infractions</span>.<br>
			<br>

			reviewer: when I clicked on GO in the View Infractions form, I got:<br>
			Debug: Error Database error in vBulletin.0.0 Alpha 35: Invalid SQL:. I will mark this
			impeded.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			Once you submit this form you will receive results in a table like this:<p class="Mfig"><img
					src="./vBulletin Manual_files/userinfraction_list.png" border="0" alt=""></p>This shows:<ul>
				<li>The user that received the infraction</li>
				<li>The user that left the infraction</li>
				<li>The date and time the infraction was left</li>
				<li>The type of Infraction</li>
				<li>The number of points that was given for the infraction</li>
				<li>The expiration time of the infraction</li>
				<li>The post that the infraction was left for</li>
			</ul>You may also delete or reverse the infraction that was left.
