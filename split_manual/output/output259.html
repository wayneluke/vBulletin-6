			User Ranks are similar to User Titles in that they allow users to progress through a number of classes
			depending upon the number of posts they have made.<br>
			<br>
			However, User Ranks are more flexible than User Titles because they can (if desired) be applied to specific
			usergroups, and can contain images and HTML in the titles.
