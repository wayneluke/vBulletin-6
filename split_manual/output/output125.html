			<br>
			The concept of inheritance as it applies to styles in vBulletin is best illustrated with an example of a
			common use for the system: customizing the look and feel of a site. You accomplish this by editing the
			colors used by vBulletin, and by editing the header and footer templates.<br>
			<br>
			Assume that you want to customize your header and footer templates, but you also want to offer a choice of
			three possible color schemes to your users: we’ll call these the Red, Green, and Blue schemes.<br>
			<br>
			You could create three new styles (Red, Green, and Blue) and customize the header and footer templates in
			each style. That is a valid solution, but has one serious disadvantage: if you decide you want to alter the
			HTML in the customized header template, you will need to edit the template in each of the three styles
			individually.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the initial page of the Style Manager with Red, Green, and Blue styles
			checked.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			A more manageable solution would involve creating a single new style, called something like “Custom Header /
			Footer” and setting up the customizations that apply to all three styles in that file. <br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the initial page of the Style Manager with the Red, Green, and Blue
			styles removed, and a style called Custom Header / Footer inserted (and checked) in their
			place.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			Then to offer the three color variants, you would create three more styles (Red, Green, and Blue) as child
			styles of the Custom Header / Footer style.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the initial page of the Style Manager with the Red, Green, and Blue
			styles re-inserted as child styles of Custom Header / Footer.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			Each of these child styles inherits the customized header and footer templates from the Custom Header /
			Footer parent style, so you do not need to edit that template in the child styles. If you choose to change
			the HTML of either the header or footer templates at some point in the future, you need only to edit those
			templates in the parent style: the changes are automatically inherited by the three child styles.<br>
			<br>
			This is a simple example, involving only the site color scheme and the header and footer templates. However,
			vBulletin allows you to create much more elaborate customizations that individually customize every template
			and every CSS attribute of a style. Each of those customized attributes can be inherited by all child
			styles.
