			Path to Tagging Options: <span class="Mprocess">Settings &gt; Options &gt; Tagging Options</span><br>
			<br>
			<strong>Enable Thread Tagging</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not to enable or disable the thread tagging system. You can choose which usergroups can apply
			tags to threads in the usergroup permissions section.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Minimum Length</strong> (default: 3)<br>
			The minimum number of characters in a tag name. This can be between 1 and 100.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Maximum Length</strong> (default:25)<br>
			The maximum number of characters in a tag name. This can be between 0 and 100.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Thread Tag Banned Words</strong> (default: none)<br>
			These words will be checked in addition to those listed in includes/searchwords.php to form a list of words
			whose use is banned in tagging.<br>
			<br>
			Separate each word with a space or carriage return.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Thread Tag Allowed Words</strong> (default: none)<br>
			Words entered here will be allowed as tags, regardless of whether or not their use would be otherwise
			disallowed due to length, censorship, commonality etc.<br>
			<br>
			If a word is specified in the “Banned” words group and here, it will be allowed.<br>
			<br>
			Separate each word with a space or carriage return.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Separators</strong> (default: none)<br>
			You can specify additional separators for tags. The comma is the default separator and cannot be removed,
			regardless of what is set here.<br>
			<br>
			Place a space between each separator. For example, "| &amp;" would mean that tags would be separated by a
			comma (,), pipe (|), or ampersand (&amp;). Separators can be multiple characters.<br>
			<br>
			If you want to include a space as a separator or within a separator, wrap the separator in { and }. For
			example, to make space a separator, you would use "{ }". To put a space within a separator, you would use
			"{| |}", This would mean that to separate tags you would have to enter "| |".<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Adding separators might make previous tags unusable. For example, if you had
					a tag "American cars" and added space as a separator, users that try to add that tag will add two
					tags, "American" and "cars".</div>
			</div><strong>Maximum Tags per Thread</strong> (default: 25)<br>
			The maximum total tags per thread. No user can add more tags than this to an individual thread.<br>
			<br>
			0 disables this.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Maximum Tags Applied by Thread Starter</strong> (default: 5)<br>
			The maximum number of tags the thread starter can apply. Even if this setting allows it, the number of tags
			in a thread cannot exceed the "Maximum Tags per Thread" setting.<br>
			<br>
			0 disables this limit. To prevent a user from tagging a thread, use usergroup permissions.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Maximum Tags Applied by Other Users</strong> (default: 2)<br>
			The maximum number of tags users other than the thread starter can apply. Even if this setting allows it,
			the number of tags in a thread cannot exceed the "Maximum Tags per Thread" setting.<br>
			<br>
			0 disables this limit. To prevent a user from tagging a thread, use user group permissions.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Force Tags to be Lower Case</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not "A" through "Z" will be replaced with "a" through "z" in tag names. Other characters will not
			be changed.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Cloud: Number of Tags</strong> (default: 70)<br>
			The maximum number of tags to display in the tag cloud.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Cloud: Number of Levels</strong> (default: 5)<br>
			The number of levels to be shown in the tag cloud.<br>
			<br>
			By default, there are 5 levels named level1 to level5, with the font size growing from its smallest size at
			level 1 to its largest at level 5.<br>
			<br>
			Increasing this value above 5 requires a template change.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Cloud: Cache Time</strong> (default: 30)<br>
			Amount of time in minutes before the tag cloud data cache is regenerated.<br>
			<br>
			A value of 0 will generate the tag cloud on each view.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Cloud: Usage History (Days)</strong> (default: 365)<br>
			The number of days’ worth of data that should be used to generate the usage-based tag cloud here.<br>
			<br>
			Tags added more than this many days ago will not change the size of the link in the cloud.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tag Cloud: Build Usergroup</strong><br>
			The tag cloud pulls together data from threads in many channels. Users might not be able to see all the
			threads that make up the tag cloud results. With this option, you can force the tag cloud to be built as if
			it were viewed by a particular usergroup.<br>
			<br>
			Live permission checking is the most accurate, but disables the above specified caching.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Enable Search Tag Cloud</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not a tag cloud relating to the frequency of tag searches is shown at the bottom of the advanced
			search.<br>
			<br>
			A usage-based tag cloud is always shown here.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Search Tag Cloud: History (Days)</strong> (default: 30)<br>
			Number of days the system will keep a record of tag searches for use in the search tag cloud.<br>
			<br>
			0 means to use all data available.<br>
