			Restricting unauthorized access to your files is one of the most important things you can do. If someone has
			access to your files, they can alter them to send data to them or they can access your database directly
			with the information given.<br>
			<br>
			The most common method of authorizing someone is called "Basic Authorization. The Basic authentication
			method transmits user names and passwords across the network in plaintext or unencrypted form. A computer
			vandal could use a network monitoring tool to intercept this information. You can use your Web server's
			encryption features, in combination with Basic authentication, to secure user account information
			transmitted across the network. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>.htaccess</strong><br>
			.htaccess is how you can easily secure files in Apache. It allows you to use Apache's configuration
			directives without editing the default configuration file (httpd.conf). This makes it useful for communities
			on shared or virtual hosting or dedicated hosting. <br>
			<br>
			There are a lot of things you can do with .htaccess but we are concerned with denying access to specific
			files and directories. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>NTAUTH</strong><br>
			Windows comes with a permissions system often referred to as NTAUTH. It is part of the NTFS file system and
			integrated into IIS and other server technologies in Windows. For instructions on how to use this to protect
			your server please see Microsoft's IIS Documentation:<br>
			<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/server/iis/default.asp?url=/windows2000/en/server/iis/htm/core/iiabasc.htm"
				target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/server/iis/default.asp?url=/windows2000/en/server/iis/htm/core/iiabasc.htm</a><br>
			<br>
			<strong>Alternatives to NTAUTH</strong><br>
			<a href="http://www.troxo.com/products/iispassword/" target="_blank">IISPassword</a> is a free utility that
			can be installed on your IIS server. IISPassword uses Basic HTTP Authentication for password protecting web
			sites on IIS, just like htaccess works on Apache. That makes your password protected Apache web site
			compatible with IIS, and vice versa. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>CHMOD, or File Permissions on your Unix/Linux System</strong><br>
			You can control who has access to files on your servers beyond whether a web browser can call them up and
			have the server execute them. This is based on file permissions and can help to protect your files if
			someone gains unauthorized access to another portion of the machine. File permissions will help protect your
			site more on a shared server which has many people accessing it than they will on a server that only you
			have access to. However it is a good practice to only give the minimum permissions that you need to give and
			allow your site to work properly.<br>
			<br>
			In our case, the web server application needs to be able to read your vBulletin files as long as PHP is
			installed as an Apache or ISAPI Module. If you are using the CGI executable, then they will probably need
			Execute permissions as well. In Linux and Unix, you change permissions using a tool called CHMOD which lets
			you set the permissions. <br>
			<br>
			CHMOD can use either bitkeys, a series of numbers to designate permissions, or letters to represent the
			permissions. Both of these can be confusing to the uninitiated. Using the numbers results in more concise
			commands with the same number of control. You will see these commonly referred to in technical
			documents.<br>
			<br>
			To set the permissions for your vBulletin files, with PHP as a Apache or ISAPI module, you would type the
			following in your command prompt on the server:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">chmod 644 *</pre>
			</div>This tells the server that the owner of the file (you) has permission to read and write to the files
			but everyone else only has permission to read them.<br>
			<br>
			If your hosting provider tells you that you need Read and Write permissions on your files then you would use
			this command:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">chmod 755 *</pre>
			</div>A more indepth tutorial on CHMOD can be found here: <a href="http://catcode.com/teachmod/index.html"
				target="_blank">http://catcode.com/teachmod/index.html</a><br>
			<br>
			Most modern SFTP clients can handle this automatically though a properties dialog on the context menu. Refer
			to your client software for documentation on how to do this. <br>
			<br>
			Please Note: If an attacker gets root access to your machine, there is no way to protect your files with
			permissions. They will be able to access everything. If this happens you will need a recent backup so you
			can recover your site.<br>
