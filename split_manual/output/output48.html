				<font size="3">What are Navigation Items?</font>
			</strong><br>
			Navigation items are the tabs and links found beneath the site logo of your vBulletin. A navigation item can
			act as either a tab or a link. Sub-navigation items appear beneath a tab and along the top of the page.
			Sub-navigation items are always links.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>

			“Off” portion of the button to the left of your username. Once the Edit Site menu appears, click on the
			“Navigation Bar” button. <br>

			</strong><br>
			To remove a navigation item from your site, make sure the ‘Edit Site’ function is turned on by clicking on
			the “Off” portion of the button to the left of your username. A menu bar will appear along the top of your
			page. <br>
			<br>
			Click on the ‘Navigation Bar’ button. This will open form beneath the menu bar. From here, click on the x
			beside the navigation item you want to remove. Once you’re done, click the ‘Save Changes’ button. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">How to Edit Navigation Items</font>
			</strong><br>
			The ‘Edit Site’ function allows you to edit and change navigation items whenever you want. If you ever need
			to change the name of the navigation item, where it points, or even in what order it’s displayed, turn on
			the ‘Edit Site’ function and click on the ‘Navigation Bar’ button that appears in the menu bar.<br>
			<br>
			Find the navigation item you want to edit and click the ‘Edit’ link to the right of its name. This opens a
			popup that allows you to change the name and URL of a navigation item. When you’re done making your changes,
			click the ‘Save’ button.<br>
			<br>
			If you want to change the order of the navigation item, simply click and drag the items into their new
			positions. Once the Navigation Bar has been changed to your liking, click the ‘Save Changes’ button. The
			page will reload with the changes you’ve made.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font size="3">How to Add Sub Navigation Items</font>
			</strong><br>
			Navigation items are tabs, while sub navigation items are links beneath their parent item. In order to add a
			sub-navigation item to a menu, you start by turning on the ‘Edit Site’ function. When the menu bar appears,
			click on the ‘Navigation Bar’ button. <br>
			<br>
			In the form that opens, click the right parenthesis to the far right of the navigation item you want to add
			the sub navigation item to. When you have the navigation item selected, click on the ‘+ New Sub Navigation
			Item’ link. <br>
			<br>
			Once the navigation item form is open, create your sub navigation item as usual and click ‘Save’. This
			returns you to the previous form. Add as many sub navigation items as you want and click ‘Save Changes’ when
			you’re finished.
