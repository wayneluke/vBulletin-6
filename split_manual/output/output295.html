			Moderators are users who are put in charge of maintaining one or more channels. Moderators are appointed by
			the vBulletin Administrator . Moderator responsibilities include deleting offensive or inappropriate posts,
			pruning old threads, and banning users from their channels. Moderator responsibilities are “assigned” to
			moderators through permissions.<br>
			<br>
			The Administrator can assign a moderator to a single channel by adding them in the Channel Manager screen.
			Administrators can also create Super Moderators by setting the user's primary usergroup to Super Moderator
			in the User Manager.<div class="Mnote">

				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Placing a user in the Moderator usergroup is only for organization. The
					default permissions of this group do not apply any actual Moderator functionality.</div>
