			<br>
			The most common reason for inactivating a forum is to do forum or database maintenance.<br>
			<br>
			While your site is inactive, only users in the Administrator usergroup can access the site. Other site
			visitors are shown an informational message that you provide.<br>
			<br>
			Remember to reactivate the forum after you have finished your maintenance tasks.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>

			<strong>Forum Active</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Select Yes to set the forum to Active for the general public.<br>
			<br>
			Select No to set the forum to Inactive for the general public but leave it set to Active for administrators.
			<br>
			<br>
			Administrators accessing the forum when it is set to Inactive see a notice displayed in the header and
			footer of each page stating that the forum is inactive.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Reason for Turning Forum Off</strong> <br>
			Enter the message you want to display to users trying to access the forum while it is set to Inactive. Your
			text message can contain HTML code but not BBCode.<br>
			<br>
			Example: The <em>forum_name</em> forum has temporarily been inactivated for site maintenance. We expect to
			be back online by 3:00am GMT. Sorry for the inconvenience.
