			There are two types of modules, System Modules and Regular Modules. The System Modules are modules that you
			can move around a page, but not remove from a page. Some of them are customizable, while others are not.
			Regular Modules are modules that you can add to and remove a page. You can also change their location on the
			page and customize most of them.<br>
			<br>
			The following is a list of modules available in vBulletin. Each article includes information of what you can
			customize.
