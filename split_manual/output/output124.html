			Like so many other systems in vBulletin, the vBulletin Styles system works around the concept of
			<em>inheritance</em>.<br>
			<br>
			In implementing styles, “inheritance” means that you can create an unlimited number of styles in which your
			site can be viewed, and customizations made in one style are inherited by all of its child styles.<br>
			<br>
			Topics in this section elaborate on the concept of inheritance with regard to the functionality of the Style
			Manager.
