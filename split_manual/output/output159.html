			Path to Notices Manager: <span class="Mprocess">Notices &gt; Notices Manager</span><br>
			<br>
			The Notices Manager is the primary page for working with notices. It lists all notices created by
			administrators for your site, and allows you to see at a glance the active status and display order of all
			notices defined in your system.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>
			</div>&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the Notices Manager page. I suggest a single screenshot instead of
			the three that were used in the V4 docs.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			To add a new notice, click <strong>Add New Notice</strong>, which takes you to the Add New Notice page.<br>
			<br>
			You can toggle the active status of all notices by checking or unchecking the <strong>Toggle Active Status
				for All</strong> checkbox. <br>
			<br>
			To edit a notice, click its title or the <strong>Edit</strong> link associated with it. <br>
			<br>
			To delete a notice, click the <strong>Delete</strong> link associated with it.<br>
			<br>
			Each notice is displayed with 3 checkboxes and a text box containing a number. These represent the active
			status, the persistent nature of the notice, whether it is dismissible, and numbers representing the
			notice's display order.<br>
			<br>
			If a notice is not active, it is never displayed to site visitors.<br>
			<br>
			A notice that is not persistent is displayed only once per browser-session; otherwise, it is displayed
			throughout the browser session.<br>
			<br>
			A message that is dismissible can be dismissed by the user. <br>
			<br>
			The display order text box controls the order in which the notice is shown, both in the Notices Manager and
			to visitors. Display order also controls the order in which notices are checked, so it's important for the
			'Notice x has not already been displayed' condition. Notices with the lowest numbers are displayed
			first.<br>
			<br>
			You can make changes to display order rankings with the arrow buttons to the left and right of the display
			order text boxes.
