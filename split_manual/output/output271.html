			The vBulletin Paid Subscriptions system allows you to charge your visitors for access to specific areas and
			services that you may offer.<br>
			<br>
			In general, this is achieved by temporarily making a subscribed user into a member of one or more specific
			usergroups, which have access to the site areas or services for which they have paid.
