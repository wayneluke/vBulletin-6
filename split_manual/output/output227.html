			You add channel permissions using various vBulletin tools, which are described in the following topics: <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_permission_duplication"
				class="Mhop">Permission Duplicating Tools</a>, <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_quickeditor"
				class="Mhop">Permissions Quick Editor</a>, and <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_quicksetup" class="Mhop">Quick
				Channel Permission Setup</a>.<br>
			<br>
			Path to viewing and editing channel permissions: <span class="Mprocess">Channel Management &gt; Channel
				Permissions</span> or <span class="Mprocess">Usergroups &gt; Channel Permissions</span>.<br>
			<br>
			You view and edit channel permissions in the Edit Channel Permissions form of the Channel Permissions
			Manager.<br>
			<br>
			<font color="red"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a level-setting screenshot of the Channel Permissions Manager
					home screen.&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			On this screen, all of your channels are listed. Beneath each channel, all of your usergroups are
			listed.<br>
			<br>
			The color of each usergroup is significant. If the usergroup text is in white, it is using the default
			permissions for the usergroup. If the usergroup text is in red, it is using permissions customized for that
			channel. If it is in yellow, it is using custom permissions from a parent channel. The circle next to each
			usergroup name is also significant. A hollow circle means the usergroup cannot view the channel, while a
			full circle means they can.<br>
			<br>
			To edit the permissions for any usergroup, or to revert them to default, click <strong>Edit</strong> next to
			the relevant group under the relevant channel.<br>
			<br>
			You can <strong>Reset</strong> or <strong>Deny All</strong> usergroups within a channel as a group.<br>
			<br>
			Other <strong>Channel Permissions Manager</strong> functions are linked from the <strong>Additional
				Functions</strong> form at the top of the page. There is detailed documentation for each (linked
			below).<br>
			<br>
			The <strong>Permission Duplicator</strong> allows you to quickly duplicate an existing permission set
			between usergroups or between channels (see the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_permission_duplication"
				class="Mhop">Permission Duplicating Tools</a> article).<br>
			<br>
			You can also access the <strong>Permissions Quick Editor</strong> from here. The Quick Editor allows you to
			quickly revert permissions to default (see the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_quickeditor"
				class="Mhop">Permissions Quick Editor</a> article).<br>
			<br>
			The last link at the top is <strong>Quick Channel Permissions Setup</strong>. You can use this to mass-apply
			permissions to multiple usergroups for a particular channel (see the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_quicksetup" class="Mhop">Quick
				Channel Permission Setup</a> article).<br>
			<br>
			Following is information about viewing, adding and editing channel permissions.<br>
			<br>
			<font color="red"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a level-setting screenshot of only the View Channel Permissions
					form of the Channel Permissions Manager.&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			All existing channels and their usergroups are listed on the form in a hierarchical format.<br>
			<br>
			To edit the permissions for a given usergroup within a given channel, click the <strong>Edit</strong> link
			to the left of the usergroup name.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>
			</div>The edit screen of the Channel Permissions Manager opens.<br>
			<br>
			<font color="red"><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a level-setting screenshot of a sample “edit”
					screen.&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			The exact contents of the edit screen varies depending on which set of permissions is being displayed.<br>
			<br>
			However, the options in the top form (Edit Channel Permissions for Usergroup <em>x</em> in Channel
			<em>y</em>) are always as follows:<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Inherit from parent (this will delete any existing permissions)</strong><br>
			To save any changes to this page, you must select "Use custom permissions" (see below). If you already have
			custom settings and want to set this usergroup back to its default, select "Use usergroup default" and click
			the <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Save&#39; button">[Save]</span> button.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">This option is not available unless you have already created custom
					settings.</div>
			</div>If you have custom settings for this group and remove them as described above, any subchannels also
			revert if they do not have custom settings explicitly set.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use Custom Permissions</strong><br>
			If you intend to make changes to anything on the remainder of the page, click this option.<br>
			<br>
			To set the Yes/No options on the rest of the screen to either all Yes or all No, click the <strong>All
				Yes</strong> or <strong>All No</strong> button.<br>
