			Prune is to delete a large number of posts and/or threads from your message board. This is often used as a
			step in maintaining a small database. To prune messages you would do so through the Admin Control Panel
			under the Threads / Posts heading or from the Forum Tools menu within a particular forum. This option only
			shows up if you have permission to use it.
