			User ranks are images or text that are assigned to your users based on their post count. The most common
			usage of ranks is that of <strong>stars</strong> that increase or change color based on the user's post
			count and usergroup.<br>
			<br>
			User's ranks generally appear beneath their username on posts, private messages, announcements, usernotes
			and in their profile.<br>
			<br>
			Ranks can be assigned to specific usergroups or they can be assigned to cover all groups who don't have a
			rank specifically assigned to them.<br>
			<br>
			As of vBulletin 3.5, it is possible for a user to display multiple ranks by being a member of multiple user
			groups, each with specific ranks. vBulletin 3.0 only allowed a single set of ranks to be displayed for a
			user. This is covered in more detail when editing a rank is discussed.<br>
			<br>
			Navigate to <span class="Mprocess">User Ranks &gt; User Rank Manager</span> to view your current ranks. If
			you have none set up, you will only see the small notice that defines user ranks.<br>
			<br>
			The figure above demonstrates a simple rank scheme. In this setup, members of the Administrator group who
			have at least 1 post would have the rank of three smilies. Since we have also set up a rank to cover All
			Usergroups, all members, including the Administrator group, with at least 10 posts would have a rank of
			.::Newbie::..<br>
			<br>
			To add a new rank, navigate to <span class="Mprocess">User Ranks &gt; Add New User Rank</span>.
