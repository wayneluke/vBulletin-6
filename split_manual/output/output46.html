			Using the Page Manager, you can re-organize your forums simply by dragging them and dropping them where you
			wish them to appear. To do this, grab the forum's handle on the far left (the dotted texture) and then drag
			the forum where you want it to appear. When you have it arranged how you want it, simply let go of the mouse
			to drop the forum in position.<br>
