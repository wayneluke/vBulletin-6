			The Moderation section is where you will find tools for you or your moderators to check on the various
			moderation queues that exist in vBulletin.<br>
			<br>
			For example, if you have chosen to moderate all posts before they are viewable, the 'Moderate Posts' link
			will show you the Post Moderation List, where you can approve or reject posts that have been made by your
			members.
