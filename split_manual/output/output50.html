				<font size="3">What is a Page?</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			As you’ve looked through vBulletin, you’ve probably noticed several mentions of Pages and wondered what we
			were talking about. In this article, we’ll try to shed some light on what Pages are in vBulletin and how you
			can use them.<br>
			<br>
			It’s pretty easy. In fact, you already know the basics of what a Page is. You’re on one right now. At its
			simplest, a Page is just like the pages you find in any other webpage. The only difference with vBulletin is
			that you can add and edit the content of the page directly without having to upload HTML or CSS files to
			your webhost. (That is, you can if you have admin permissions.) <br>
			<br>
			The new vBulletin interface allows you to add new pages in addition to changing the content on each
			individual page. <br>
			<br>
			So, now that you know what a Page is, why don’t we show you how to make and then edit one?
