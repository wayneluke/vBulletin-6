			There are two major parts to successfully move your vBulletin forums from one server to another. These
			are:<br>
			<br>
			1. The vBulletin files, including all the vB files currently on your server as well as any attachments,
			avatars and profile pics (if you store these in the file system instead of the database) along with any
			custom images.<br>
			<br>
			2. The vBulletin database which contains the actual data itself, including the user info, posts, threads,
			forums, setting, styles, languages, etc. <br>
			<br>
			This guide will help you move your vBulletin forum from one server to another. Please note that while you
			can move the files themselves with FTP, moving the database generally <strong>requires</strong> Telnet or
			SSH access to both servers. (Other methods are available but are less reliable.)<br>
			<br>
			If you only have this access on one of the servers, you may need to ask your host to assist you with the
			steps you cannot perform.<div class="Mwarn">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Specific cookie domains (<em>Cookie Domain</em>) and cookie paths (<em>Path
						to Save Cookies</em>) may cause problems if you are moving servers and changing the URL to your
					forums.<br>
					<br>
					If you are unsure whether your cookie settings will cause problems after the move, we recommend
					resetting your cookie path to <span class="Mtype">/</span> and removing any cookie domain value
					<strong>before</strong> the move. An incorrectly set cookie domain or path will likely prevent you
					from accessing your control panel.</div>
