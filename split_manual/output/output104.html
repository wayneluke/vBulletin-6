			This section will show the different search engines installed in vBulletin and allow you to switch between
			them.<br>
			<br>
			In a new installation of vBulletin.0.4 and higher, there two search engines installed. The default is called
			"DB Search" and is an indexed implementation stored in a number of tables within your database. This will
			allow you to search all content types marked as "Searchable" when they are created/installed in your
			system.<br>
			<br>
			The second search implementation uses Sphinx Search. Sphinx is an open source full text search server,
			designed from the ground up with performance, relevance (aka search quality), and integration simplicity in
			mind. It's written in C++ and works on Linux (RedHat, Ubuntu, etc), Windows, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and a
			few other systems. To use this search engine, please see the instructions on <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_searchtype_install_sphinx" class="Mhop">Installing
				Sphinx</a>.<br>
			<br>
			You may be able to find alternative search engines from third-party vendors or possibly at
			http://www.vbulletin.org.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Changing search implementations will require you to rebuild the search index
					before the search function will return results. For the DB Search this can be done via Maintenance
					&gt; Update Counters. Reindex can take a long time for large boards. Some high performance search
					engines may provide a faster alternate method of doing a full reindex, consult the documentation
					provided with your search type. Consult the documentation for your search type to learn how to
					rebuild the search index for it.</div>
