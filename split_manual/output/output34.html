			After the upgrade process is complete, you will be presented with a link to your Admin Control Panel. Before
			clicking this link, you should open up your FTP client application again and browse to the
			<strong>/core</strong> folder inside your forums directory.<br>
			<br>
			You should <em>delete</em> the entire <strong>core/install</strong> directory. Doing so will not impact
			vBulletin's operation on your site. Once you have deleted this directory, you can return to the installer
			script and click the link to enter the Administrator Control Panel of your freshly installed vBulletin!<br>
