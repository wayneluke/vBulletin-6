			To access the <strong>Upload Smilies</strong> panel, click the following to your left: <span
				class="Mprocess">Smilies &gt; Upload Smilies</span>.<br>
			<br>
			On this screen, you can upload one image at a time through your browser for use on your forum. To do this,
			both your web server and PHP must have permission to write files to disk. If they do not, this will fail.
			<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">The directory that you are trying to put the file in must be CHMOD 777.
					Consult your FTP program documentation for how to do this.<br>
					<br>
					If you don't know how to do that you can also use the alternative feature to add one or more smilies
					through the <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_topicsandreplies_smilies_add"

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Filename</strong><br>
					Click on the <strong>Browse..</strong> button and select from your hard drive the smilie you want to
					upload.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Title</strong><br>
					This is the title you want to give to describe your smilie, for example - <em>Happy Face</em>.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Text to Replace</strong><br>
					This is the replacement text for the smilie. When a user types this text in a post, it will get
					replaced with the smilie image.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Smilie File Path</strong><br>
					Type the path of the smilie directory. An example would be <em>images/smilies</em>. This directory
					should be readable and writable by the webserver (usually CHMOD 777).<div class="Mnote">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">This path is relative to the <em>core</em> directory. Best practice
							is to add all smilies to the <em>core/images/smilies/your-folder-name</em> giving a path of
							<em>images/smilies/your-folder-name/filename</em></div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Smilie Category</strong><br>
					This drop down box will have all the possible smilies categories - select one to add this smilie to
					this category.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Display Order</strong><br>
					If you know which order you'd like to give to your smilie you can enter it here, this is an optional
					field. If you don't know what the display order should be you can leave this field empty, you can
					always change it later. View the <a
						href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_topicsandreplies_smilies_add_order"
