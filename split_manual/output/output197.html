			Path to Search for Users: <span class="Mprocess">Users &gt; Search for Users</span>.<br>
			<br>
			After you have requested a search for users, the search results page displays the users who match your
			search criteria. The columns displayed depend on what you chose on the search screen. By default, user name,
			email, join date, last visit, and post count are displayed.<br>
			<br>
			In the search results, the user name and email fields are links. Clicking on a user name will take you to
			the User Manager where you can edit the user’s profile. Clicking on the email field lets you send an email
			to the user.<br>
			<br>
			In addition, the Options column contains links you can use to manage a user, including the following:<br>
			<br>
			<strong>View / Edit User</strong><br>
			<br>
			Displays this user’s information.<br>
			<br>

			<strong>Edit Access Masks</strong><br>

			<strong>Delete User</strong><br>

			action cannot be undone. Click the <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Yes&#39; button">[Yes]</span>
