			<strong>Add New Notice</strong> or <span class="Mprocess">Notices &gt; Add New Notice</span>.<br>

			The Notices Manager provides controls to create and edit notices for your site, and to set up criteria for
			when each notice should appear.<br>
			<br>
			The top part of the page deals primarily with the text and HTML tagging, while the bottom of the page sets
			up the display criteria.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>
			</div>
			<font size="3"><strong>Notice Details</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the top half of the Add New Notice page, through the “Dismissible” radio
			buttons.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Title</strong><br>
			The title is an administrative convenience only to help in identifying notices. It is never shown to
			visiting users. You can add multiple translations of the title text using the Translations link.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Notice HTML</strong><br>
			The Notice HTML textbox contains the text and HTML of the notice to be displayed to users when the active
			criteria are met.<div class="Mwarn">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">vBulletin allows any valid HTML tags here, so be sure not to include any
					tags that could potentially break your layout or allow site abuse.</div>
			</div>You can use the special variables {userid}, {username}, {musername} and {sessionurl} in the HTML to
			personalize the notice text. For example, <em>Hello, {username}, how are you?</em> is replaced in the actual
			notice by <em>Hello, John Doe, how are you?</em> when John Doe is logged on.<br>
			<br>
			Here is a more complex example, making use of the {sessionurl} variable to make links within the site work
			properly:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">Hello, {musername].&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=”member.php?{sessionurl}u={userid}”View Your Profile&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
			</div><strong>Display Order</strong><br>
			The Display Order text box controls the order in which the notices are shown, both in the Notices Manager
			and to visitors. Display order also controls the order in which notices are checked, so it's important for
			the 'Notice x has not already been displayed' condition.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Active</strong><br>
			If a notice is not active, it is be displayed to visitors under any circumstances. The Active control is
			useful to use when you want to temporarily disable a notice without actually deleting it completely.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Persistent</strong><br>
			A notice that is not persistent is displayed the first time a user visits the site and then disappears until
			he or she visits again (it is displayed once per browser-session).<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Dismissible</strong><br>
			A notice that is dismissible can be dismissed by the user after viewing.<br>
			<br>
			<font size="3"><strong>Display Criteria</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			The lower part of the form contains controls to set up display criteria.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the bottom half of the Add New Notice page, starting with “Display this
			notice if...”&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			To activate a criterion, check the box next to the criteria text, and then fill in any controls that are
			part of that criterion.<br>
			<br>
			You can activate as many criteria as you like, but if any of the active criteria are not satisfied, the
			notice will not show. The following is a list of criteria you can use:<br>
