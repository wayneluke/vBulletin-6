			To access the <strong>Unsubscribe</strong> panel, click the following: <span class="Mprocess">Threads &amp;
				Posts &gt; Unsubscribe</span>.<br>
			<br>
			On this page, you will be presented with two options for managing the thread subscriptions for your
			users.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Unsubscribe All Users from Specific Threads</strong> allows you to quickly remove all thread
			subscriptions from specific threads. Enter the thread IDs of the threads you wish to unsubscribe all users
			from; separate each with a space.<br>
			<br>
			To obtain the thread ID, find the thread you want to remove. The link to the thread should look like
			http://www.example.com/forum_title/x-thread_title where <em>forum_title</em> is the forum title,
			<em>thread_title</em> is the thread title, and <em>x</em> is the thread ID you want. You would enter
			<em>x</em> into the form on this page. If there are multiple thread IDs, then separate them by spaces (not
			commas).<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Unsubscribe All Threads from Specific Users</strong> allows you to quickly remove all of a user’s
			thread subscriptions. One reason you might do this is if the user’s email has been bouncing recently.
			However, this is not a temporary removal; you will not be able to restore the subscriptions in the
			future.<br>
			<br>
			Here, you specify:<ul>
				<li><strong>User Name</strong> – name of the user whose subscriptions you wish to remove.</li>
				<li><strong>Find All Threads Older Than X Days</strong> – allows you to only remove subscriptions to
					threads that are more than this number of days old.</li>
				<li><strong>Channel</strong> – allows you to only remove subscriptions to threads in specific channels.
				</li>
			</ul>
