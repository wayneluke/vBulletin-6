			The first thing you will need to do when installing vBulletin is to download the latest version from the
			Members' Area.<br>
			<br>
			You will need to log-in to the Members' Area using the Customer Number and Customer Password that was
			emailed to you when you purchased your license.<br>
			<br>
			Once logged in, you will see a list of <strong>Current Licenses</strong>. For each active license that you
			own, there will be a <strong>Download vBulletin link</strong> that you can click.<br>
			<br>
			Click the link for the license you want to use and you will be taken to the download page, where you will be
			given options for how to download the latest vBulletin package.<br>
			<br>
			By default compression is performed on the JavaScript files included within the clientscript directory in
			order to reduce the size of the files.<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" target="_blank">
				YUI Compressor</a> is used to do this but you can choose uncompressed JavaScript files using the option
			described below.<br>
			<br>
			You can choose from the following options:<ul>
				<li><strong>PHP File Extension</strong><br>
					As a general rule, web servers will use .php as the extension for PHP scripts, but some servers may
					use a different extension, or you may simply wish to use a different extension out of your own
					preference. Various extensions are available here for you to choose.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Download File Format</strong><br>
					This option allows you to choose the compression format of the package you are about to download.
					Most people will want to download the .zip package as WindowsÂ® has in-built support for zip files.
					However, if you are downloading the package directly to a Linux server you may prefer to use the
					tarball (.tar.gz) format.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>CGI Shebang</strong><br>
					This option will only be of use to you if your server runs PHP as a CGI rather than as a web server
					module. If your server runs PHP as a CGI and requires a shebang (such as #!/usr/bin/php) then you
					can enter the required text here and it will automatically be inserted into whichever PHP files in
					vBulletin require its use.<br>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Download File</strong><br>
					Use this option to control the contents of the package you are about to download. For example, if
					you have previously installed vBulletin you will probably not need to download the images again, so
					you can use this control to specify that the package you download does not contain the images
					directory. You can also download the uncompressed JavaScript package with this option.<br>
				</li>
			</ul>When you have set the <strong>download</strong> options you can click the Download button to start the
			download. When the download prompt window appears, you should choose the <strong>Save</strong> option and
			choose a directory on your computer in which to save the package.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/downloading_package.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			The package will then be downloaded and saved to the location you specified.<br>
