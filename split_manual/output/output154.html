			vBulletin's default phrases are sometimes updated during product upgrades. In the Phrase Manager is a screen
			that shows you a list of customized phrases that might need to be edited or re-translated because the
			default phrases have changed.<br>
			<br>
			If no no phrases have changed for which you have customized phrases, the following message appears when you
			go to Find Updated Phrases: All phrases are up-to-date.<br>
			<br>
			If phrases for which you have customized phrases have changed, a screen similar to the following
			appears.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert screenshot of changed phrases that also have custom phrases.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			To edit a custom phrase associated with a changed default phrase, click the <span class="Mlink"
				title="Click the &#39;Edit&#39; link">[Edit]</span> link to the right of the phrase. On the Edit page
			you can either modify or remove your customized phrase.
