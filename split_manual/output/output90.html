			<br>
			The User Registration options allow you to control how new user registrations are handled on your site. <br>
			<br>
			You can activate the COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) registration system to comply with
			COPPA laws that require children under the age of 13 to get parental consent before they can post.<div

			<br>
			<strong>Allow New User Registrations</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			Temporarily (or permanently) allow or prevent anyone new from registering. <br>
			<br>
			If you set this option to No, anyone attempting to register is told that you are not accepting new
			registrations at this time.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use COPPA Registration System</strong> (default: Enable COPPA)<br>
			<br>
			Use the COPPA registration system, which complies with COPPA laws and requires children under the age of 13
			to get parental consent before they can post.<br>
			<br>
			For more info about this law, go to <a

				target="_blank">http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus45-how-comply-childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule</a>.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>COPPA Registration System Cookie Check</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			If you select Yes, the vBulletin system saves a cookie to the user's computer if an age under 13 is entered.
			Subsequent registration attempts will fail, no matter what age is entered. This applies only if the previous
			option is set to either ‘Enable COPPA’ or ‘Deny registration for users under 13 years’.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Moderate New Members</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			Allows you to validate new members before they are classified as registered members and are allowed to
			post.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Send Welcome Email</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			If you select Yes, a welcome email that uses the email body/subject phrases for 'welcomemail' is sent to new
			users.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">If you require emails to be verified, this email is sent after the user has
					activated his or her account. If you moderate new memberships, no welcome mail is sent since the
					user is already receiving an email as part of the moderation mechanism.</div>
			</div><strong>Welcome Private Message</strong><br>
			<br>
			If you select Yes, a welcome private message (PM) is sent to new users. Input the username of the user from
			which this PM is to be sent. To alter or translate this message, use the email body/subject phrases for
			'welcomepm'.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">If you require emails to be verified, this message is sent after the user
					has activated his or her account. You must also ensure that <em>Receive Private Messages</em> is
					enabled in the <strong>Default Registration Options</strong>.</div>
			</div><strong>Email Address to Notify About New Members</strong><br>
			<br>
			The email address you enter receives an email message when a new user signs up. Leave the option blank to
			disable this function.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow Multiple Registrations Per User</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			<br>
			By default, vBulletin stops users from signing up for multiple names by checking for a cookie on the user's
			machine. If one exists, the user cannot not sign up for additional names. However, this does not stop users
			from logging out and then registering new accounts.<br>
			<br>
			If you want to allow users to sign up for multiple names, select Yes for this option, so they are not be
			blocked from registering additional usernames.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Verify Email Address in Registration</strong><br>
			<br>
			If you set this option to Yes, new members are not allowed to post messages until they go to a link that is
			sent to them in an email when they sign up.<br>
			<br>
			If a user's account is not activated by the user visiting the link, it will remain in the Users Awaiting
			Activation usergroup.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Require Unique Email Addresses</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			The default for this option is to require unique email addresses for each registered user. This means that
			no two users can have the same email address.<br>
			<br>
			You can disable this requirement by setting this option to No.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Minimum Username Length</strong> (default: 3)<br>
			<br>
			Enter the minimum number of characters in a valid username.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Maximum Username Length</strong> (default: 25)<br>
			<br>
			Enter the maximum number of characters in a valid username.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Illegal User Names</strong><br>
			<br>
			Enter names that you do not want people to be able to register. If any of the strings are included within
			the username, the user is given an error message. <br>
			<br>
			For example, if you make the name <em>John</em> illegal, the name <em>John</em>athan is also be
			disallowed.<br>
			<br>
			Separate names with spaces.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Username Regular Expression</strong><br>
			<br>
			Use this option to require that the username match a regular expression (<a
				href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php" target="_blank">PCRE</a>).<br>
			To disable this function leave the option blank. <br>
			<br>
			Examples:<br>
			^[A-Z]+$ - Characters from A-Z only<br>
			^[A-Z ]+$ - Characters from A-Z including space<br>
			^[A-Z0-9 ]+$ - Alphanumeric characters including space<br>
			^((?!&amp;#\d+;)[\x20-\x7E])+$ - ASCII characters from 32-127<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>User Referrer</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			If you enable the User Referrer system, a user who visits your site through a link that contains
			<em>referrerid=xxx</em> gives referral credit to the owner of the referrerid when they register (where
			<em>xxx</em> is the userid of the referring user).<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Default Registration Options</strong><br>
			<br>
			The user options on the New User creation form in the Admin control panel, as well as the New User
			registration form default to the settings you specify here, which include:<br>
			<br>
			<blockquote>Receive Admin Emails<br>
				Invisible Mode<br>
				Display Email<br>
				Receive Private Messages<br>
				Send Notification Email When a Private Message is Received<br>
				Pop up a Notification Box When a Private Message is Received<br>
				Enable Visitor Messaging<br>
				Limit usage of Visitor Messages to Contacts and Moderators<br>
				Allow vCard Download<br>
				Display Signatures<br>
				Display Avatars<br>
				Display Images<br>
				Display Reputation<br>
				Automatic Thread Subscription Mode<br>
				Message Editor Interface<br>
				Thread Display Mode<br>
				Require Birthday</blockquote>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Username Reuse Delay</strong> (default: 365)<br>
			<br>
			When a username is changed, you can prevent users from registering with that original name for a certain
			length of time. <br>
			<br>
			Use this setting to determine the time before a deleted or previous username can be reused, or set it to 0
			to disable this function.
