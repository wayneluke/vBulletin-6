			</div>The available fields are:<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Points</strong><br>
			User's infraction point total at which this infraction group will apply.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Primary Usergroup</strong><br>
			This is the usergroup to which this infraction group applies. Setting this to “-- All Usergroups--” applies
			this infraction group to all users.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Override with Permissions from Usergroup</strong><br>
			When sufficient infraction points are accumulated by a user, that user is added to this infraction
			group.<br>
			<br>
			Infraction groups work in the opposite manner from normal usergroups. When a user is assigned to an
			infraction usergroup, the user's normal permissions are determined and then the user’s combined infraction
			groups permissions are determined. If any permission in an infraction usergroup is set to “No”, then the
			user will lose that permission. “No” permissions override “Yes” permissions.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Override Display</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not to override the user's username markup and user title with the markup and user title from the
			infraction usergroup.
