			The many phrase variable names in vBulletin have their values stored as strings when the vBulletin cached
			language data is generated or regenerated.<br>
			<br>
			For example, the phrase variable <span class="Mvar">show_all_users</span> is stored as Show All Users, and
			<span class="Mvar">additional_options</span> is stored as Additional Options.<br>
			<br>
			Sometimes the strings contain substitution variables that are not replaced with specific values until
			runtime.<br>
			<br>
			For example, the phrase variable <span class="Mvar">showing_avatars_x_to_y_of_z</span> is stored as the
			following string with substitution variables <span class="Mvar">{1}</span>, <span class="Mvar">{2}</span>,
			and <span class="Mvar">{3}</span>:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">Showing Avatars {1} to {2} of {3}
</pre>
			</div>At runtime, the string might contain the values 10, 20, and 24 in place of <span
				class="Mvar">{2}</span>, and <span class="Mvar">{3}</span>:<br>
			<br>
			<strong><br>
				Showing Avatars 10 to 20 of 24.<br>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			Suppose you wanted the output string to look like the following:<br>
			<br>
			<strong><br>
				24 Avatars Total. Displaying 10 - 20.<br>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			You could accomplish that by changing the string to the following:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">{3} Avatars Total. Displaying {1} - {2}.
</pre>
			</div>As you can see, the order of the substitution variables can be changed. The important thing is that
			you reference the correct substitution variable number for the output variable you want.<br>
