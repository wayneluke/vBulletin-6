			<strong>Site Builder</strong> is the newest innovation in vBulletin’s line of site management products. It
			allows an admin user, with the correct permissions, to change and edit the content and look of their site
			without logging in to the <strong>AdminCP</strong>. Where <strong>Site Builder</strong> deals with the
			outward facing portion of a site, the <strong>AdminCP</strong> controls the nuts and bolts of the system.
			<br>
			<br>
			The <strong>Site Builder</strong> allows an admin to add various functionalities, dictate what they do, and
			where they’re placed on the site. It can control how your navigation bar is organized as well as which HTML
			ads appear in your header, and what the site logo is.<br>
			<br>
