			<br>
			In vBulletin you have the choice of storing attachments in your site database or file system.<br>
			<br>
			By default vBulletin stores attachments in the database, because every server that supports vBulletin can
			use this method. However, not every server can store attachments in the file system.<br>
			<br>
			Following are some factors to consider in choosing which storage method to use. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Storing Attachments in the Database</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Pros<ul>
						<li>Backing up your database also backs up your attachments</li>
						<li>Does not consume any of your file system storage limits (unless MySQL storage counts)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Cons<ul>
						<li>Can increase server load on large sites</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul><strong>Storing Attachments in the File System</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Pros<ul>
						<li>Better performance for large sites</li>
						<li>Easier to back up your database</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Cons<ul>
						<li>Does not work if SAFE MODE is enabled on your server</li>
						<li>Need to back up attachments separately from database</li>
						<li>Consumes space on your file system</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
