			If you have created a style of which you are proud, you may want to share it with other vBulletin
			administrators. Alternatively, you may simply want to back up all your templates and style settings to a
			file on your computer.<br>
			<br>
			Both of these actions are catered for by the Style Download system, which allows you to download all the
			customized StyleVars, CSS, Replacement Variables and Templates into a single XML file which can be imported
			to any other site running the same version as it was created in.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">While the style downloaded will be compatible with the version it was
					created in, it <em>may</em> also work on other versions of vBulletin depending on the level of
					customisation and changes made to the software between versions. Issues caused by styles created in
					different versions of vBulletin to that the style is being imported to wonâ€™t be officially
					supported.</div>

			The Style Download form is relatively simple, with only a few controls to manipulate.<ul>
				<li><strong>Style</strong><br>
					Use this menu to pick the style you want to download</li>
				<li><strong>Product</strong><br>
					Select the vBulletin product for which you want to download. If you have additional products
					installed via add-ons, you should use this option to download any specific style changes for that
					add-on.</li>
				<li><strong>Title</strong><br>
					By default, the downloaded XML file will contain the title of the style as it exists on your web
					server. If you would like the XML file to store a different name for the style you are downloading,
					enter it here.</li>
				<li><strong>Filename</strong><br>
					This field allows you to specify the name of the XML file vBulletin will send to your web browser
					when you click the <strong>[Download]</strong> button. Note that most browsers allow you to rename a
					file as you download it, so you can leave this as it is.</li>
				<li><strong>Options</strong><br>
					The options give you a choice of two types of style download.<br>
					<br>
					If you choose to Get customizations made only in this style, then the style XML file you download
					will contain <strong>only</strong> items that are customized specifically in the style you are
					downloading. Items that are inherited from parent styles will <strong>not</strong> be included.<br>
					<br>
					On the other hand, if you choose to Get customizations made in this style and all parent styles, the
					style XML file will contain not only items customized specifically in the style you are downloading,
					but also any items that have been customized in a parent style.</li>
			</ul>Clicking the [Download] button will instruct vBulletin to package your style up into an XML file and
			start downloading it to your web browser.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">The XML file you download can <strong>not</strong> contain any image files.
					If your style includes custom images, you should download these separately using an FTP client.
