			vBulletin Supports API Extensions which allow Addon Developers to create extensions to the core of the
			software itself. These aren't plugins but extensions of the actual classes of plugins. Installed
			predominantly in a central location, auto-installing and more capable than plugins. Extensions tie directly
			into the existing API classes and extend them. They can provide output via template hooks, insert template
			hooks into templates and include their own templates, etc... Templates themselves are more robust as well as
			they can pull information directly from the database using special tags, if needed and without additional
			coding.<br>
