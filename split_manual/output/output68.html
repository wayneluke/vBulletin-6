			The <strong>Search Widget</strong> is a module that displays the search results for a pre-configured search
			created by the administrator. You can use it to highlight particular discussions, images, videos and
			attachments.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/search_module-01.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<strong>Widget Title</strong><br>
			This is the title of the search results widget that appears at the top of the search on the page.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Number of Results</strong><br>
			This is the number of results the search widget will display on the page.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Keywords</strong><br>
			These are the search terms used to find the results for the search widget. You can enter more than one
			keyword, separated by a space.<ul>
				<li><strong>Title Only</strong><br>
					Checking this box restricts the search to the titles of the available items.</li>
			</ul><strong>Members</strong><br>
			This limits the search results to the listed members in the text field. If you create the search using User
			A, only posts that User A will show up in the <strong>Search Widget</strong>. You can enter more than one
			username, separated by a comma.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Tags</strong><br>
			This narrows the search to posts that contain the tags you’ve selected. You can either enter tags in the
			text box provided or select them from the list of available.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Date Range</strong><br>
			This limits the number of days the search will go back in order to find results. The count starts from the
			current day back.<ul>
				<li><strong>Last Visit</strong><br>
					This sets the start date back to the last time the user visited.</li>
			</ul><strong>Sort By</strong><br>
			This controls how the search results are sorted. The results can be sorted by the following categories:<ul>
				<li><strong>Relevance</strong> - sorts the results by the relevance of the results to the search you’ve
					entered</li>
				<li><strong>Title</strong> - sorts of the results alphabetically by the title of the item</li>
				<li><strong>Members</strong> - sorts the results alphabetically by the member that created it</li>
				<li><strong>Date - started post</strong> - sorts the results by the date of the item was created and not
					by the latest post mase</li>
				<li><strong>Date - last update</strong> - sorts the results by the last reply made to the item</li>
				<li><strong>Replies</strong> - sorts the results by the most replies made to the original item</li>
				<li><strong>Order</strong> - the order in which the results appear (descending and ascending)</li>
			</ul><strong>Types</strong><br>
			This restricts the type of items the search result will display.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Search Options</strong><br>
			This restricts the search to the following options:<ul>
				<li><strong>Search in featured content only</strong> - search results will only come from the featured
					content section</li>
				<li><strong>Search in my following only</strong> - search results will only come from the members,
					topics and forums the user is following</li>
			</ul><strong>Sources</strong><br>
			This dictates which forums the search will use to find keyword matches.<br>
