			User titles are the descriptions of a user that are displayed under his or her username in a post. These
			titles will often refer to one of three things:<ul>
				<li>The user’s amount of activity on the board (examples: <em>Junior Member</em>, <em>Senior
						Member</em>). This is usually set through the default user title ladder that is described in the
					<a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_users_userprofile_usertitles_manager"
						class="Mhop">User Title Manager</a> article.</li>
				<li>The user’s relationship to the board (examples: <em>Administrator</em>, <em>Moderator</em>). This is
					usually set through a usergroup-specific user title that overrides the default user title ladder.
				</li>
				<li>A custom title, specified by the user. This can refer to anything the user desires. The user may not
					have permission to set their own user title; it is controlled by a usergroup permission. More
					information about Usergroup and Permissions can be found <a
						href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_usergroup_permissions" class="Mhop">here</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
