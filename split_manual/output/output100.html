			<strong>Multi-Quote Enabled</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not Multi-Quote is enabled.<br>
			<br>
			If this option is enabled, an additional button appears on replies. Users can click as many of these buttons
			as they want. Once they click a reply button, the content of each of the selected replies is quoted and
			shown in the reply window.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Multi-Quote Quote Limit</strong> (default: 0)<br>
			Enter a value to limit the number of quotes that can be created with Multi-Quote. Once this limit is reached
			the user cannot add any more quotes.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">The Quote BB code can still be entered manually: this is not a limit on the
					number of quotes in a reply post.</div>
			</div><strong>Minimum Characters Per Post</strong> (default: 10)<br>
			If this number is set to a value greater than 0, users must enter at least that number of characters in each
			new reply post.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Setting this to 0 will not completely disable the minimum characters per
					reply check. Users must always enter at least 1 character.</div>
			</div><strong>Maximum Characters Per Post</strong> (default: 10000)<br>
			Replies that contain more characters than the value specified here will be rejected with a message telling

			<strong>Maximum Characters Per Thread/Post Title</strong> (default: 85)<br>

			<br>
			<strong>Ignore Words in [QUOTE] Tags For Min Chars Check</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Setting this option to Yes causes the system to not count words in quote tags towards the total number of
			characters posted. <br>
			<br>
			If you enable this option, all text within quote tags in a reply will be ignored when determining how many
			characters that post has. Some users like to quote large replies and add a smiley or some other small bit of
			text as a response, and this prevents that.<br>
			<br>
			Users can specify their own title if they want to do so.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Maximum Images/Videos Per Post</strong> (default: 3)<br>
			Maximum number of images or videos per reply..<br>

			all-uppercase text with at least the number of characters specified from all caps to camelcase (initial caps
			only).<br>

				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Disable this for some international forums with non-English character sets,
					as this may cause problems.</div>
			</div><strong>Minimum Time Between Posts</strong> (default: 30)<br>
			Minimum number of seconds between replies from a single user.<br>
			<br>
			This option enables a floodcheck, which disallows users from posting another reply within the timespan
			specified. <br>
			<br>
			For example, if you specify a timespan of 30 seconds, a user cannot reply again within 30 seconds of the
			last reply.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Administrators and moderators are exempt from any floodcheck.</div>

			<br>
			<strong>Post Edit History</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not to log the previous versions of replies when they are edited. <br>
			<br>
