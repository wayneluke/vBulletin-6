			If you have closed your forums for the upgrade you can now open them, or you can wait until you have gone
			through the next two steps checking for updated templates and phrases.<br>
			<br>
			When a new version of vBulletin is released, it is common for some of the default <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/templates_intro" class="Mhop">templates</a> to have been
			updated to accommodate new features or fix bugs.<br>
			<br>
			If you have not customized any of your templates, this need not concern you, but if you <em>have</em>
			customized some of the default templates there are a few steps you will need to follow after you have
			finished running all the appropriate upgrade scripts.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">When running vBulletin upgrade scripts, one of the final steps imports the
					newest version of the default style.<br>
					<br>
					Any templates that you have <em>not</em> customized will automatically be updated to use the newest
					versions.<br>
					<br>
					However, any templates that you have customized <strong>will not</strong> be altered or overwritten
					by importing the latest style, hence the need for the following steps.</div>

									have been renamed or else some other change may have been made that will render your

								<li>Click the <span class="Mlink"
										title="Click the &#39;Revert&#39; link">[Revert]</span> link for each template,

			</table>On the release of a new vBulletin version, the release announcement posted in the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=1" target="_blank">Announcements Forum</a> at
			vBulletin.com will usually contain a list of updated templates.<br>
			<br>
			This list will often tell you whether or not the changes made to each template were purely cosmetic, in
			which case you will have no need to perform the steps above for that template, or if the changes require you
			to revert or manually edit your customized templates to maintain full working order.
