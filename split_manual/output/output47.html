			</strong><br>
			Alright, so now that you have your first page set up, you might want to change the site logo. You no longer
			have to login to the AdminCP in order to do that. You can change the site logo directly through the Site
			Builder. When you have it turned on, click on the “Header” button. You’ll see a form similar to the one
			below pop up:<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-07.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			The next thing you want to do is click on the “Edit” button beside the site logo. It will open an upload
			page. Use this form to upload your new site logo to the site. A preview of the image will appear like
			so:<br>
			<br>
			Please note that this is just a preview and the changes have not been saved. If you navigate away from the
			page or click the “Exit without Saving” button, the site logo you uploaded will not replace the default
			logo. Only after you click “Save Changes” and confirm the change will the new logo display on your main
			site.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">The maximum width of your site logo is set at 320 pixels.</div>

				<font size="3">How to Add HTML Ads</font>
			</strong><br>
			You can add any HTML Ad directly into the header of your site. All you need is the HTML for the ad and to
			turn on the Site Builder function for your vBulletin. Click on the “Header” button in the Site Builder menu.
			This will open a form like this:<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/ad-form01.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			In the Header Form, click on the “Edit” button to the right of the “Header Add HTML Module” title. Once the
			Custom HTML Module appears, enter a title and then copy and paste your Ad's HTML into the text box provided.
			You can use the conditions provided to choose when the Ad will show and to whom. When you are finished
			configuring your Ad, click “Attach”.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/ad-form02.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			The Header form will return you to a preview of the page so you can see how the Ad looks. When you’re
			satisfied with how it looks, click on the “Save Changes” button to complete the addition of your ad. The
			Header form allows you to choose between having one or two ads show in the header.
