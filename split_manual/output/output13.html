			To extract the files from the package, open the folder on your computer where you saved the vBulletin
			package and right-click on its icon, then choose <strong>Extract All</strong> from the pop-up menu.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/extract.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			This will open a wizard to guide you through the unzipping progress. Accept the default options suggested
			and the system will decompress the files from the zip package.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/extract-02.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			When the unzipping progress is complete, you will find that the process has created a new folder called
			<strong>upload</strong> and another called <strong>do_not_upload</strong>.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>upload</strong> - This folder contains the vBulletin files that need to be uploaded to your web
			server.<br>
			<br>
			However, before you upload the files you must make some changes to the vBulletin configuration files. The
			first file is located in the upload folder itself and is called <strong>config.php.bkp.</strong> The second
			file is located in the <strong>core/includes</strong> folder (within the <strong>upload</strong> folder) and
			is called <strong>config.php.new</strong>.<br>
			<br>
			You will need to rename both files, so vBulletin will be able to use them.<br>
			<br>
			First you must do is to rename this file from <strong>config.php.bkp</strong> to <strong>config.php</strong>
			(removing the temporary <em>.bkp</em> extension).<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/rename-config-01.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			Second you must do is to rename this file from <strong>config.php.new</strong> to
			<strong>config.php</strong> (removing the temporary <em>.new</em> extension).<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/rename-config-02.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">vBulletin uses URL rewrites throughout the software. This is done using URL
					Rewrites in an .htaccess file in the root of the vBulletin installation. However, to prevent custom
					htaccess rules from being overwritten on a server, we don't provide this file directly. Instead, we
					provide a 'dummy' file called <em>htaccess.txt</em>. If you don't have an existing .htaccess file in
					the directory that you're installing vBulletin into, rename this file from <em>htaccess.txt</em> to
					<em>.htaccess</em> (<strong>NOTE:</strong> The period <em>before</em> htaccess is important - you
					must name the file as shown)<br>
					<br>
					If you do have an existing .htaccess file in the directory, you will need to copy the contents of
					the <em>htaccess.txt</em> file into your existing .htaccess file.</div>
			</div>The second folder is <strong>do_not_upload</strong> - This folder contains tools to perform various
			tasks on your board<ul>
				<li><strong>searchindex.php</strong> - This file will allow you to rebuild the default vBulletin search
					index.</li>
				<li><strong>vb_backup.sh</strong> - This file will allow you to run a database backup via SSH/Telnet or
					a scheduled backup through cron.</li>
				<li><strong>tools.php</strong> - This file must be uploaded to the admincp folder and allows you to
					perform certain tasks should your board go down or you accidentally lock yourself out of the Admin
					Control Panel. <strong><em>This file must be deleted immediately after use or it will cause a SEVERE
							security problem.</em></strong></li>
			</ul>
