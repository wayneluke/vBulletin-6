			Path to adding or editing promotions: <span class="Mprocess">Usergroups &gt; Promotions</span>.<br>
			<br>
			You add or edit promotions in the Usergroup Manager. To edit an existing promotion, click its
			<strong>Edit</strong> link in the Controls column to get to the Usergroup Manager Promotion form. To add a
			new promotion, click the <strong>Add New Promotion</strong> button to get to the Add New Promotion form.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of the Add New Promotion form.&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			Except where otherwise noted, the options are the same whether you are adding or editing the promotion.<div
				class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click on <strong>Save</strong> for your changes to take effect.
				</div>
			</div><strong>Usergroup</strong><br>
			Select the usergroup to which you want this promotion to apply. A user must be a member of this usergroup if
			he or she is to be considered for this promotion.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">This option is not available when you are editing an existing promotion. If
					you need to change a promotionâ€™s source usergroup, create a new promotion and delete the old one.
				</div>
			</div><strong>Reputation Level</strong><br>
			Reputation is a ranking of your user's benefit to your channel. Users gain and lose reputation based on how
			their posts are scored by other channel participants.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Days Registered</strong><br>
			The number of days a user has been registered.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Posts</strong><br>
			User post count.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Promotion Strategy[</strong><br>
			Select from the pulldown list which of the conditions must be true for this promotion to be invoked.
			Conditions inside parentheses are evaluated first.<br>
			<br>
			For example, suppose your promotion settings are the following:<br>
			<br>
			Reputation Comparison Type = Greater or Equal to<br>
			Reputation Level = 1000<br>
			Days Registered = 30<br>
			Posts = 100<br>
			Promotion Strategy = Posts and (Reputation or Date)<br>
			<br>
			If a user has a reputation value of 1100, has been registered for 20 days, and has 150 posts, he or she will
			be promoted.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Promotion Type</strong><br>
			Type of promotion the user is to receive if promoted. This can be either a primary usergroup or an
			additional usergroup.<br>
			<br>
			Which promotion type to select depends on how groups and permissions are configured. If the promotion causes
			only a few changes to permissions and settings then it is easier to set up a new usergroup that grants the
			new permissions and settings, and then to have the promotion add membership to that group as an additional
			usergroup. If the promotion involves many changes then a primary usergroup change might be called for.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Reputation Comparison Type</strong><br>
			Choose Greater Than or Equal To or Less Than.<br>
			This option applies only to reputation and only when reputation has been selected as part of the promotion
			strategy above.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Move User to Usergroup</strong><br>
			Select the usergroup the user will be moved to when he or she is promoted.
