			Data APIs / Data Managers are object-oriented PHP classes that act to centralize the manipulation of object
			data within vBulletin.<br>
			<br>
			For example, instead of having different code to update a user record from the Admin Control Panel and from
			the User Profile editor, both systems can now simply direct their data to the user data manager, which will
			deal with ensuring that the data is valid and complete, then save it to the database.
