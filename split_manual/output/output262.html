			This example will demonstrate how you would setup a group of ranks for all users, based on post count.
			Administrators will get a special rank and will not have the rank that everyone else has.<br>
			<br>
			Since we have set the <strong>Display Type</strong> of the <span class="Mmono">All Usergroups</span> ranks
			to <em>Displaygroup</em>, we have invoked the special setting mentioned in <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_users_userprofile_userranks_modifyuserranks"
				class="Mhop">Modifying User Ranks</a>. The <span class="Mmono">All Usergroups</span> ranks will display
			for everyone except for those in the <span class="Mmono">Administrator</span> group since that group has a
			rank explicitly defined, the ADMIN rank. Since we have set <strong>Stack Rank</strong> to
			<strong>No</strong> for both ranks, that means that the rank will appear all on one line.<br>
			<br>
			Ranks are evaluated by usergroupid in reverse order. This means that the <span class="Mmono">All
				Usergroups</span> rank will appear last. If you wish to have ADMIN appear on one line, and the <span
				class="Mmono">All Usergroups</span> rank on another, you would set the <strong>Stack Rank</strong>
			option of the <span class="Mmono">Administrator</span> group to <strong>Yes</strong>. This will result in an
			html <span class="Mkey" title="Hit the &#39;br /&#39; key(s)">&lt;br /&gt;</span> being placed after ADMIN.
			The <span class="Mmono">All Usergroups</span> rank would then follow, displaying on a new line.<br>
			<br>
			The ADMIN rank would only display for users that had the <span class="Mmono">Administrator</span> group as
			their primary Usergroup or as a Secondary group. If the <strong>Display Type</strong> of the <span
				class="Mmono">Administrator</span> group's rank was changed to <em>Displaygroup</em>, then this rank
			would only show for those user's who have set the <span class="Mmono">Administrator</span> group as their
			displaygroup. That would be accomplished either by the user only being in the <span
				class="Mmono">Administrator</span> group, being a member of multiple groups assigned by the admin and
			having the Admin group as their displaygroup, or by having used Public Groups to to join the Admin group and
			choosing that as their display group.<br>
			<br>
			The last scenario is quite unlikely since you would not allow members to join the Administrator group on
			their own choosing but the logic can be applied to other groups.
