			The vBulletin Admin Control Panel can be accessed by pointing your browser at
			<em>http://www.example.com/forums/admincp/</em>.<br>
			<br>
			The first thing you will see when you access the Control Panel is a prompt to log in. You will be presented
			with this login prompt even if you are already logged into the public area of the board. This is an
			additional level of security.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/admincp-login01.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			To log in, simply enter the username and password of a user account with administrator privileges, such as
			the one you created towards the end of the installation script process.<br>
			<br>
			There are a couple of extra options that can be set on the login form. To see them, click the
			<strong>[Options]</strong> button to expand the form to its full size.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/admincp-login02.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			The two options you can set from the login form are:<ul>
				<li><strong>Style Choice</strong><br>
					vBulletin comes with a selection of styles in which you can view the control panel. Try them out and
					see which one you like best, or if you are feeling adventurous, create your own!</li>
				<li><strong>Save Open Groups Automatically</strong><br>
					This option allows you to have the system automatically save your preferences for which options in
					the Admin CP navigation panel are opened and which are collapsed by default, without you having to
					manually save the preferences.</li>
			</ul>Clicking the <strong>[Log in]</strong> button will submit the login details and options you have set,
			and log you in to the board.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">If you changed the value of <em>$admincpdir</em> in the config.php file and
					have renamed the admincp directory, the location at which you access the control panel will have
					changed accordingly.</div>
			</div>
