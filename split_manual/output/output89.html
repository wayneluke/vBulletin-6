			Path to Email options: <span class="Mprocess">Settings &gt; Options &gt; Email Options</span> <br>
			<br>
			Use the Email options to set up the behavior of the email features throughout your site.<br>
			<br>
			Relying on the PHP internal mail function has always caused problems with a few configurations. The PHP
			internal mail function is simply a wrapper for the system’s own mail program such as sendmail or procmail.
			The problems occur when certain configurations have extra authentication settings or confusing line endings.
			This has been resolved by the introduction of our mail class to correct any problems that may occur with the
			internal mail function and also to allow the use of SMTP which will completely bypass PHP's own internal
			mail function.<br>
			<br>
			You can enable the SMTP server options here.<div class="Mnote">

			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Enable Email features?</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Enable the following email-sending features:<br>
			<blockquote>Report Bad Post</blockquote>
			<blockquote>’Contact Us’ Link</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Email a Member</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Email this Page to a Friend</blockquote>
			<blockquote>New Post Notifications to Members</blockquote>
			<br>
			You can turn off the Send to Friend feature for individual user groups in the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/vb5_usergroup_manager" class="Mhop">Usergroup
				Manager</a>.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow Users to Email Other Members</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Set this option to Yes to allow users to send emails to other users.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Use the Use Secure Email Sending option to determine how the emails are
					sent.</div>
			</div><strong>Use Secure Email Sending</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			If Allow Users to Email Other Members is set to Yes, this option specifies how members’ email addresses
			should be displayed.<br>
			<br>
			If this option is set to Yes, an online forum must be filled in to send a user an email, which hides the
			destination email address.<br>
			<br>
			If this option is set to No, the user is simply given the email address to send email using his or her email
			client application.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Email Flood Check</strong><br>
			Specify in seconds how much time must elapse before a user can send consecutive emails.<br>
			<br>
			Setting ‘0’ disables this flood check.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Administrators are always exempt from this floodcheck.</div>
			</div><strong>Use Mailqueue System</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			<br>
			When enabled, subscription emails generated by your site are processed in batches to lessen the load on your
			server. Account activation, lost passwords and other vital emails are sent instantly regardless of this
			setting. If your site has low traffic, subscription emails might be delayed.<br>
			<br>
			If you have a large site, consider enabling locking. This prevents a rare situation where the same email is
			sent multiple times.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Number of Emails to Send Per Batch</strong> (default: 10)<br>
			vBulletin includes a mail queuing system to prevent bottlenecks when sending large volumes of email. Use
			this option to specify how many emails are sent per batch.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Bounce Email Address</strong><br>
			The email address to which bounce messages are directed. If this field is blank, the webmaster email address
			is used.<br>
			<br>
			This email is used with an SMTP server or when the Enable ‘-f’ Parameter email for sendmail is switched
			on.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Enable ‘-f’ Parameter</strong><br>
			Some sendmail servers might require the ‘-f’ parameter to be sent with email calls from PHP. If you are
			having problems with users not receiving email, try enabling this option; however, in all likelihood, your
			problem is not being caused by this setting.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">This setting does not work when PHP SAFE MODE is enabled.</div>
			</div><strong>Use Bulk Header?</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			<br>
			Mail servers using Exchange send auto-responders unless you mark your email as bulk mail. While there is no
			documented case of emails being marked as spam directly due to this header, what other mail servers do with
			this header is unpredictable.<br>
			<br>
			Set this option to Yes if you want to reduce number the auto-responders in your webmaster email from
			Exchange servers. <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Encode as UTF-8</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			<br>
			If you set this option to Yes, emails are re-encoded to UTF-8 before sending, if possible.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>SMTP Email</strong><br>
			Set this option to Yes to use an SMTP server rather than the internal PHP mail() function.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>SMTP Host</strong><br>
			If you have enabled SMTP mail, specify the host here. You might find that specifying an IP address rather
			than a domain name results in better performance.<br>
			<br>
			Example: <em>smtp.gmail.com</em><br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>SMTP Port</strong><br>
			If you have enabled SMTP mail, specify the port here.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>SMTP Username</strong><br>
			If you have enabled SMTP mail and your server requires authentication, specify your username here.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>SMTP Password</strong><br>
			If you have enabled SMTP mail and your server requires authentication, specify your password here.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>SMTP Secure Connection</strong> (default: none)<br>
			If you have enabled SMTP mail and your server requires a TLS connection, set this to Yes.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">This option requires OpenSSL support to be compiled into PHP.</div>
