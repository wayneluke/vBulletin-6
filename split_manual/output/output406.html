			In order to restore your database via SSH or Telnet you will require 2 things:<br>
			<br>
			1) SSH or Telnet access to your site. You will need to check with your hosting company to see if this is
			available.<br>
			<br>
			2) An SSH/Telnet Client, such as PuTTy.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">If your database backup resides on your home computer, you will first have
					to upload it via FTP to your website</div>
			</div>Open your SSH/Telnet client and log into your website. The command line prompt you will see will vary
			by OS. For most hosting companies, this will bring you into the FTP root folder.<br>
			<br>
			You can either change directoties to wherever the backup is located and type in the following:<br>
			<br>
			<span class="Mtype">mysql -u <strong>dbusername</strong> -p <strong>databasename</strong> &lt;
				backupname.sql</span><br>
			<br>
			Or if you do not want to change directories and you know the path to where the backup is located, type in
			the following:<br>
			<br>
			<span class="Mtype">mysql -u <strong>dbusername</strong> -p <strong>databasename</strong> &lt;
				/path/to/backupname.sql</span><br>
			<br>
			You will be prompted for the database password. Enter it and the database will backup.<br>
			<br>
			If your hosting company has you on a remote MySQL server, such as mysql.yourhost.com, you will need to add
			the servername to the command line. The servername will be the same as in your config.php. The command line
			will be:<br>
			<br>
			<span class="Mtype">mysql -h <strong>servername</strong> -u <strong>dbusername</strong> -p
				<strong>databasename</strong> &lt; backupname.sql</span><br>
			<br>
			Or:<br>
			<br>
			<span class="Mtype">mysql -h <strong>servername</strong> -u <strong>dbusername</strong> -p
				<strong>databasename</strong> &lt; /path/to/backupname.sql</span>
