			The most important concept in vBulletinâ€™s permission system is <em>inheritance</em>. In vBulletin a new
			usergroup on your site can inherit the permissions you have already established for another existing
			usergroup. In the new usergroup you can then override any permissions you want to be different from the
			original.<br>
			<br>
			In vBulletin there are two levels at which you can specify usergroup permissions.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Global Permissions</strong><br>
			The first is at a the global level, which applies to all channels on the site. To edit global permissions,
			go to <span class="Mprocess">Usergroups &gt; Usergroup Manager &gt; Edit Usergroup</span>.<br>
			<br>
			The permissions you specify at the global level apply everywhere on on your site unless you override them at
			at a lower level (for example, at the channel level).<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Channel-level Permissions</strong><br>
			To edit channel-level permissions, go to <span class="Mprocess">Usergroups &gt; Forum Permissions</span>.
			Permissions you specify for a channel are automatically inherited by any child channel, unless overridden
			for the child channel.
