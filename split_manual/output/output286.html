			vBulletin allows you to choose which storage type you want to use for your user picture images (profile
			pictures). You can either opt to have the user pictures stored in the database or in a file system on your
			server. You can change the storage type at anytime.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Database vs File System</strong><br>
			There are no real advantages or disadvantages to using one of these storage types over the other. Keeping
			items in the database provide an easier backup method, while using a file system may be slightly more
			efficient as there are less queries that need to be run. But both require disk space and are easy to manage
			via the AdminCP.<br>
			<br>
			At the end of the day it comes down to your own preference on how you want to manage your user picture
			images and how you want to store them.<div class="Mnote">
