			<strong>How to enhance access for longer standing members:</strong><br>
			<br>
			Some site owners opt to reward users who have been members of their site for a significant time by giving
			them access to features that newer members don’t. This example deals with how to set this up.<br>
			<br>
			For this example, we will use the following criteria:<br>
			<br>
			- Initial Usergroup: <em>Registered Users</em><br>
			- ‘Enhanced Member’ Usergroup: <em>Enhanced Members</em><br>
			- Length of Time Registered: <em>730</em><br>
			<br>
			As all new users go into the Registered Users usergroup by default, simply adjust the permissions for this
			group to what you wish them to have. Then, you need to setup the usergroup for those members who will have
			enhanced access. To do this, create a new usergroup based off the Registered Users usergroup and set the
			permissions to give them the enhanced level of access..<br>
			<br>
			For more information on usergroups and permissions, please see <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_usergroup_permissions" class="Mhop">this section of
				the manual</a> relating to these.<br>
			<br>
			Once you have your usergroups setup to your needs, you should create the appropriate Promotion. Using the
			criteria above, your Promotions screen should look like this:<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;&lt;Screenshot of Promotions screen with the following criteria&gt;&gt;&gt;
				</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			Explanation:<ul>
				<li><strong>Usergroup</strong><br>
					This is the usergroup that the users are currently a member of, i.e. Registered Users. The Promotion
					will only apply to these users.</li>
				<li><strong>Days Registered</strong><br>
					These are the number of days that a user will have access to view your site before they are moved
					(promoted) to the usergroup that has no access, in this case 730.</li>
				<li><strong>Promotion Strategy</strong><br>
					As this example will have a user promoted after 730 days (2 years) have elapsed since registration,
					this should be set to ‘Join Date’</li>
				<li><strong>Promotion Type</strong><br>
					Set this option to ‘Primary Usergroup’. When the Promotions Scheduled Task runs, the user will then
					have their Primary Usergroup changed.</li>
				<li><strong>Move User to Usergroup</strong><br>
					This should be set to the new usergroup that was setup earlier, i.e. Enhanced Members’</li>
			</ul>Note that the ‘Reputation Level’ and ‘Posts’ values although completed will have no effect on this
			Promotion as the Strategy has been set to ‘Join Date’. Once the above have been set, click the
			<strong>Save</strong> button. <br>
			<br>
			Now complete, this Promotion will move active users from the ‘Registered Users’ usergroup to the ‘Enhanced
			Members’ usergroup once they have been registered for 730 days in your forum.
