			Path to Managing Languages: <span class="Mprocess">Languages &amp; Phrases &gt; Language Manager</span>.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert screenshot of Language Manager screen.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			This screen lists all languages you have installed. Next to each language is a link for phrase-editing, as
			well as links to modify the language settings and download the language as an XML file.<br>
			<br>
			Clicking on <strong>Edit / Translate</strong> allows you to edit the translation for phrases.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Edit Settings</strong> allows you to edit the settings of the language.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Delete</strong> removes the language from your vBulletin site.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Download</strong> lets you download a language set as an XML file, which consists of all phrases you
			have translated for that language. You can distribute this to other vBulletin owners.<br>
			<br>
			The <strong>Set Default</strong> button allows you to set a language as the default for your site. The
			default language is shown to registered users who did not select a language at registration, and to
			unregistered users or those who are not logged in.<br>
			<br>
			After the language list section there are links that let you search for phrases, view a language quickref,
			or rebuild all languages.<br>
			<br>
			At the bottom of the screen are buttons to add a new language and download or upload existing language sets.
