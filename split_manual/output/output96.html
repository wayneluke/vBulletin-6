			</div><strong>Log Emails to a File</strong><br>
			To log all emails to a file, enter the path to the file here. The file will be saved as {filename}.log. <br>

				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">1048576 bytes = 1 megabyte</div>
			</div>If you want your vBulletin error logs to be rotated when they reach a certain size, enter the maximum
			file size in bytes.<br>
			<br>
			When a log file reaches this size, it will be renamed as <span class="Mvar">{filename}{unix
				timestamp}.log</span> and a new file will be created.<br>
			<br>
			Set this value to 0 to disable log rotation.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Disable Database Error Email Sending</strong> (yes/<u>no</u>)<br>
			<br>
			To prevent vBulletin from sending email to the $config['Database']['technicalemail'] address you specified
			in config.php, set this value to Yes.<br>
			<br>
			Error reports about database connection errors will still be sent.<br>
			<br>
			We do not recommend that you set this value to Yes unless you are logging database errors to a file.<br>
