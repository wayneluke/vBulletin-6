			The vBulletin User Infraction system is designed to automate the management of “misbehaving” users.<br>
			<br>
			The first step in setting up your user infraction system is to create infraction levels. These levels vary
			based on the content of the site and the scale of the system that you want to create. You can create just a
			few levels or set up many levels covering a myriad of infractions.<br>
			<br>
			When creating levels, keep in mind the point total at which you want to start penalizing users by taking
			away permissions. If you envision taking away a certain permission when a user accumulates 10 infraction
			points, then you need to consider how many points should be given for each infraction and how quickly the
			user can get to 10 points.<br>
			<br>
			Each infraction level has an expiration time. When the infraction expires, the associated points are removed
			from the user's point total and the user's infraction groups are recalculated.<br>
			<br>
			Infraction levels can also be allowed to be given as warnings. A warning does not add any infraction points
			to the user's point total. Warnings serve as a method to remind users of your site's rules and encourage
			them to be followed without awarding infraction points. Moderators can give an infraction or a warning for
			those levels that have the warning ability enabled. <br>
			<br>
			When an infraction is given, a message is sent by the moderator to the receiving user that explains why the
			infraction is being given. This message uses the <strong>Private Messaging System</strong> if it is enabled.
			Otherwise, if your site has email enabled, an email is sent. At the same time, a new thread for discussion
			of the infraction is created in a predetermined channel. This channel is set up in the <span
				class="Mprocess">Settings &gt; Options &gt; User Infractions &amp; Post Reporting Options</span>
			section. For more information, read the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_users_userinfractions_postreport" class="Mhop">User
				Infractions &amp; Post Reporting Options</a> article.<br>
			<br>
			The second step in setting up the system is to create infraction groups that penalize users in whatever way
			you define.<br>
			<br>
			Normal permissions work by combining all of a user's usergroup permissions and granting a permission for any
			that are set to ‘Yes’. Infraction group permissions work in the reverse: the permissions are combined and
			any permission set to ‘No’ is taken away from the user.<br>
			<br>
			When you set up your infraction usergroups (in the <strong>Usergroup Manager</strong>), set all permissions
			to ‘Yes’, and then change those that need to be removed in case of an infraction to ‘No’.<br>
			<br>
			Any permissions set to ‘No’ affects all channels. If you want to penalize a user only in certain channels,
			set all permissions to ‘Yes’ and then set up custom permissions at <span class="Mprocess">Usergroups &gt;
				Channel Permissions</span> for the channel in question using the Infraction Group. For more information
			on channel permissions, read the <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_channels_permissions"
				class="Mhop">Channel Permissions</a> article.<br>
			<br>
			A user can be in multiple infraction groups: they will be assigned to all groups that apply to their primary
			usergroup ID that have a point total less than or equal to their accumulated points.<br>
			<br>
			Navigate to <span class="Mprocess">User Infractions &gt; User Infraction Manager</span> to view current
			Infraction Levels and Infraction Groups. If you don’t have any set up, you can add them from this
			screen.<br>
