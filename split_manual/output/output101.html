				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>

			</div><strong>Required Thread Rating Votes to Show Rating</strong><br>
			Thread ratings are relatively inaccurate with just a few votes. This setting can be used to delay the
			results until enough votes have been cast to give a more accurate rating. This option specifies the number
			of thread rating votes that must be cast of a particular thread before the current rating is displayed on
			forumdisplay.php and showthread.php.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow Thread Rating Vote Changes</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			This allows users to change their original rating of a thread.<br>
