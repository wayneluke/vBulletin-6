			The config.php has several settings that can help protect your vBulletin installation. These settings are
			listed below. Since these are security features, less is more. Give out as few permissions as possible,
			otherwise your forum will not be as secure. Ultimately you should only include yourself as the owner in any
			of the settings. It is recommended to leave the "Users with Query Running Permissions" setting empty until
			you need to actually run a query. At that time, change the setting and reupload your config.php. The change
			will take effect immediately. When you are done running your queries, change the setting back to the
			default. With this one setting and your password, an attacker has complete control of your database.<div

			</div><strong>Securing your config.php file</strong><br>
			Making sure no one edits this file after you upload it to the server is a large priority. If an attacker can
			change the contents of this file they can easily take control of your community. The first thing you want to
			do is restrict access to this file via file permissions. Make sure no one can access this except you. Use
			the techniques described under Restricting Access to secure this file.<br>
			<br>
			One thing you might consider doing is denying access via a Web Browser at all times. This file only needs to
			be read internally via PHP and should not be accessed with a Web Browser. On most installations, this would
			never occur. However should your version of PHP stop working for some reason, then the file can be served as
			plain text and any prying eyes can see it. You can counter this on the webserver level with tools like
			.htaccess and NTFS Permissions.<br>
			<br>
			Here is an example .htaccess file that would prevent access to the config.php. You would place this file
			within your /includes directory.<br>
			<br>
			Apache 2.2:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">&lt;Files config.php&gt;
order deny,allow
deny from all
&lt;/Files&gt;</pre>
			</div>Apache 2.4:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">&lt;Files "config.php"&gt;  
  Require all denied
&lt;/Files&gt;
</pre>
