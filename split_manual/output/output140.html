			Regardless of any languages you enable as administrator (for example, Spanish or German) there are always
			two that always exist in vBulletin: the Master Language and the Custom Master Language. They are generally
			protected from being directly edited.<br>
			<br>
			The Master Language is where all of vBulletinâ€™s untranslated, default phrases exist. It is important to have
			the original version of all phrases available for reference purposes. You cannot directly edit these
			language phrases.<br>
			<br>
			The Custom Master Language contains only custom phrases you have created, which can be accessed as if they
			were part of the Master Language.
