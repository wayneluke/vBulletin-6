			Path to add new prefixes: <span class="Mprocess">Topic Prefixes &gt; Topic Prefix Manager &gt; click Add
				Prefix next to the Topic Prefix Set</span><br>
			<br>
			Once you have created a prefix set, you may add any number of prefixes to that set. If a thread has a prefix
			applied to it, the prefix will show anywhere the thread title shows. For that reason, you must define two
			versions of the prefix: a plain text version and a rich text version. See below for more information.<br>
			<br>
			The following options are on the page for adding/editing a prefix set:<ul>
				<li><strong>Prefix ID</strong> - This is the unique identifier for this prefix. Only one prefix can have
					this value and the value may only contain A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ (underscores) only. It will be the id
					used in the URL to select other threads with this prefixid. Once you pick a prefix set id, you will
					not have a chance to change it (it will not be editable when editing the prefix set).</li>
				<li><strong>Prefix Set</strong> - The set this prefix is to be placed in. This prefix will only be
					selectable in forums that have this set enabled. If you change this set, topics that can no longer
					use this prefix will have it removed!</li>
				<li><strong>Title (Plain Text)</strong> - This is the title of the prefix, using no special markup. This
					will be shown in the prefix list menu, when the topic title is shown in the navigation bar, or when
					the topic title is used in an email. example - For Sale</li>
				<li><strong>Title (Rich Text)</strong> - This is also the title of the prefix, but you may use HTML to
					add additional markup to the title. This version of the prefix will be shown in a list of topics and
					within the thread itself. example of a red prefix title - &lt;span style=”color: red;”&gt;For
					Sale&lt;/span&gt; - which will display as <font color="red">For Sale</font>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Display Order</strong> - The sort order for this prefix. Lower values will be displayed
					first within the selected prefix set.</li>
			</ul>If the topic title is a link to view the topic, the prefix will generally not be linked. However, the
			prefix will be included in the link if the topic title is used in the navigation bar.<br>
			<br>
			Prefixes will also be placed directly before a thread title, with only a space separating them. For this
			reason, you will probably want to include something to make the prefix stand out from the title. In the rich
			text value, this could be color, italics, or an image (<font color="red">For Sale</font>). However, in the
			plain text version, you may need to include a colon or square brackets ("For Sale:" or "[For Sale]").
