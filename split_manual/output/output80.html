			<strong>Forum Name</strong><br>
			Name of your forum site, which appears in the title of every page.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Forum URL</strong><br>
			URL of your forum site. Do not add a trailing slash (/) in the name.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Homepage Name</strong><br>
			Name of your home page, which appears at the bottom of every page.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Homepage URL</strong><br>
			URL of your home page.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Contact Us Link</strong><br>
			Link for contacting the site administrator, which appears at the bottom of every page. To use the built-in
			email form, specify <span class="Mmono">sendmessage.php</span>; otherwise use something like <span
				class="Mmono">mailto:webmaster@sitename.com</span> or your own custom form.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow Unregistered Users to use 'Contact Us'</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			This option applies only if you specify <span class="Mmono">sendmessage.php</span> in the Contact Us Link
			option. To require guests to pass Human Verification in order to use this form, enable the option found in
			the Human Verification Options.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Contact Us Options</strong><br>
			You can predefine subjects (and corresponding recipients) for users to pick from when using the default
			Contact Us form. Include one subject per line. An Other option is automatically added to the end when the
			form is viewed.<br>
			<br>
			Each subject must be placed one per line, meaning that you need to enter a carriage return between subject
			(press &lt;Enter&gt;). If you wish to direct the email from a subject to a particular user, you can either
			specify the user's userid on the forum or their email address. You do this by placing the item in brackets
			at the start of the subject.<br>
			<br>
			Example:<br>
			{1} Site Feedback<br>
			{example@example.com} Help<br>
			Registration<br>
			<br>
			Feedback sent to the first option "Site Feedback" would be directed to the email address of Userid #1.
			Feedback sent to the second option "Help" would be directed to the email address "example@example.com".
			Feedback sent to the third option "Registration" would be directed to the Webmaster's email address.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Webmaster's Email</strong><br>
			Email address of the webmaster. This can be different than the technical contact listed in the <span
				class="Mmono">includes/config.php</span>. The webmaster receives all emails from vBulletin itself except
			for database errors.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Contact Us Email</strong><br>
			Default email address for emails sent from the Contact Us page. If you leave this option empty, the
			webmaster's email is used.<br>
