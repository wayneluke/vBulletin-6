			Modifying a module’s settings is just as easy as adding it or removing it from your page. Again, make sure
			that <strong>Site Builder</strong> is turned on before clicking on the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Edit Page&#39; button">[Edit Page]</span> button. From here, click on the pencil
			icon to the left of the delete icon. Each module has its own individual settings form that will pop up. <br>

			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-04.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			After making the adjustments you want to the module, click the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Save Changes&#39; button">[Save Changes]</span> button at the bottom of the form
			that appears. Different modules will show different forms. Please note that the changes you’ve made will not
			be permanent until you’ve clicked the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Save Changes&#39; button">[Save Changes]</span> again at the top of the page.
