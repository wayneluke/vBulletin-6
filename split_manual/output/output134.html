			This section covers how to download and upload styles.<br>
			<br>
			Downloading styles is handy when you want to make a backup of your templates and options, or share your work
			with other forum administrators.<br>
			<br>
			Uploading styles is handy to revert to a backup or applying the same style to several boards. You can use
			this option to import a style that someone has given you.<br>
			<br>
			Make sure you read and understand all the options to avoid incomplete style downloads / uploads.<div

				<div class="Mnotewarninner">When you upload or download a style, the process will not transfer any image
					files. Your image files should be managed with an FTP client.</div>
