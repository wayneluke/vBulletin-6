			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-01.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			In order to create a page, you need to turn on the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Edit Site&#39; button">[Edit Site]</span> function. You do that by clicking the
			“Off” button to the right of the Edit Site button. This will reveal a menu along the top of your webpage.
			From here, you want to click on the <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;New Page&#39; button">[New
				Page]</span> button.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-02.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			This opens a form with three tabs. For the moment, let’s stick to the &lt;Add Module&gt; tab in the form.
			vBulletin comes with a variety of basic pages created when you first install or upgrade to it. However you
			may wish to add custom pages for a variety of reasons. We will walk through an example of making a front
			page for your site. You can make this the first page that your users see when they arrive on your site.
			We’ll start with an Announcement module, an Activity Stream module, and an Online Users module<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/site-builder-03.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You don’t have to build your front page with these modules if you don’t want
					to. In fact, you can build it with a totally different set of modules depending on what you want to
					use your vBulletin for. Remember, this is just a tutorial to show you how to do things and not a
					hard guide. Have fun!</div>
			</div>To find the modules, you can either use the Search field to the left of the module list or the slide
			bar beneath the menu. Once you’ve found these four modules, drag and drop them to the page. From here, you
			can move them around in whatever order you want. If you’re following along, we’ve set them up like this:<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-03.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			Ok, so, now that we have the page organized like we want, we’re going to play with the options for each one.
			Although each module has different options, the options can be accessed in the same way. Just click on the
			“Edit” button and a form will pop up with a choice of options.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-04.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			In this tutorial, we’ll work with the Activity Stream module and just let the others go as their defaults.
			So, to continue, click on the “Edit” button. In the new form, change the “Show Filter” to “All” and then
			click the <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Save&#39; button">[Save]</span> button.<br>
			<br>
			Go ahead and change the options for your other modules. Once you’re done, click the <span class="Mbutton"
				title="Click the &#39;Save Page&#39; button">[Save Page]</span> button. <br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-05.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			This opens a new form like the one above. On this form, enter a name for the page into the Page Name field.
			The URL for your page will automatically fill out with the name you entered for the page. If you want to
			change it, feel free to right now. The last thing you want to do before saving is to name the new template
			that the save will generate along with your page. This saves the layout, order, and settings of the page so
			you can reuse it at a later time if you need to make another page likes this one.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/add-a-page-06.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally, click on the <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Ok&#39; button">[Ok]</span> button and
			that’s it.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner"><strong>Color Styles</strong><br>
					The Color Styles tab is used to change the color layout of the page you are creating. For the
					tutorial, click <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/sitebuilder_stylegenerator"
