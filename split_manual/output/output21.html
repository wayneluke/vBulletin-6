			<span class="Mmono">MySQLi</span> is an improved database layer for PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1+. It is strongly
			recommended that <span class="Mmono">MySQLi</span> be used for increase performance.<br>
			<br>
			To enable <span class="Mmono">MySQLi</span>, view <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/install_core_config_php" class="Mhop">Editing the Core
				config.php File</a>.<br>
			<br>
			The Core config.php contains two advanced settings that you may need when <span class="Mmono">MySQLi</span>
			is in use. These settings are to be ignored as long as you are not having issues of the following type:<div
				class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre
					class="Mcodeblock">MySQL Error  : Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,COERCIBLE) and (utf8_general_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation</pre>
			</div>Generally, this error only happens when your database's character set has been changed from the
			default of latin1. To begin to resolve this problem, you must first determine what character set is being
			used for your database.<br>
			<br>
			From the Administrator Control Panel, go to <span class="Mprocess">Admin CP-&gt;Maintenance-&gt;Execute SQL
				Query</span>. If you receive a no permissions message, please refer back to <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/editconfig" class="Mhop">Editing the vBulletin
				Configuration File</a> on how to grant the appropriate permissions so that you may execute queries.<br>
			<br>
			Enter the following query in the <span class="Mscreen">Manual Query</span> input box and press <span
				class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Continue&#39; button">[Continue]</span><br>
			<br>
			<span class="Mscreen">SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'char%'</span>
			<p class="Mfig"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/mysqli_query.png" border="0" alt=""></p>The results
			screen will show your current character set settings:<p class="Mfig"><img
					src="./vBulletin Manual_files/mysqli_query_results.png" border="0" alt=""></p>If the values <span
				class="Mscreen">character_set_database</span> and <span class="Mscreen">character_set_connection</span>
			are different then this can be resolved by continuing this solution.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">If the values are the same, then your problem will not be solved by this
					solution. Please contact vBulletin Support in this case. You may have tables in your database that
					are configured to use a different character set than your database is. All of your tables will need
					to be updated to use the same character set. This condition can be caused by changing the character
					set of your database after vBulletin has been installed. Upgrades may create tables that are in your
					new character set, which will cause problems.</div>
			</div>Your <span class="Mvar">character_set_connection</span> needs to be updated to be the same as your
			<span class="Mvar">character_set_database</span>.<br>
			<br>
			Create a new file in your forums include directory named <span class="Mprocess">mysqli.ini</span>. Inside of
			this file place:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">[client]
default-character-set=utf8
</pre>
			</div>The value <strong>utf8</strong> will need to be the same value that appeared as your <span
				class="Mvar">character_set_database</span> in the previous step. Generally, this will be utf8 but you
			may have a special case that requires a different setting.<br>
			<br>
			Edit the <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/editconfig" class="Mhop">vBulletin Configuration
				File</a> file by following the instructions in the previous section.<br>
			<br>
			Uncomment the following line by removing the two slashes from the beginning<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre
					class="Mcodeblock">//    $config['Mysqli']['ini_file'] = 'c:\program files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1\my.ini';</pre>
			</div>Change the line to point to the location of the <span class="Mprocess">mysqli.ini</span> file that you
			created in the previous step. Example:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre
					class="Mcodeblock">$config['Mysqli']['ini_file'] = 'c:\program files\apache group\apache\htdocs\forums\includes\mysqli.ini';</pre>
			</div>If you have enabled <span class="Mmono">MySQLi</span> and entered the correct path to your new <span
				class="Mprocess">mysqli.ini</span> file, then this problem should be resolved.
