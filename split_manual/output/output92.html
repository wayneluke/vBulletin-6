			With these options you can control the way your users edit their profile.<br>

			<span class="Mprocess">Settings &gt; Options &gt; User Profile Options</span><br>
			<br>
			<strong>Enabled User Profile Features</strong><br>
			Use this option to globally enable or disable the various user profile-related features. Additional options
			are available for each feature in their respective sections. The available options are:<ul>
				<li><strong>Groups</strong> - Enables or disables the <strong>Groups</strong> feature across the board
				</li>
				<li><strong>enable_albums</strong> - Enables or disables the <strong>User Albums</strong> feature across
					the board</li>
				<li><strong>Friends</strong> - Enables or disables the <strong>Friends</strong> feature across the
					board. This does not disable either contacts or the ignore list feature. </li>
				<li><strong>Visitor Tracking</strong> - Enables or disables <strong>Visitor Tracking</strong> for user
					profiles only.</li>
				<li><strong>Enable visitor Messaging</strong> - Enables or disables the <strong>Visitor
						Messaging</strong> option for a user profile.</li>
				<li><strong>Profile Styling</strong> - Enables or disables a user’s ability to style their profile.</li>
			</ul><strong>Require Date of Birth</strong><br>
			This requires the users to provide a valid date of birth (1902 to current year).<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">When this is set to Yes users cannot edit their date of birth once it has
					been set.</div>
			</div><strong>User Title Maximum Characters</strong><br>
			This is the maximum number of characters allowed for a user's custom title.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Censored Words for Usertitle</strong><br>
			Type all words you want censored in the Usertitle in the field below. Do not use commas to separate words,
			just use spaces. For example, type "dog cat boy", rather than "dog, cat, boy."<br>
			<br>
			If you type "dog", all words containing the string "dog" would be censored (dogma, for instance, would
			appear as "***ma"). To censor more accurately, you can require that censors occur only for exact words. You
			can do this by placing a censored word in curly braces, as in {dog}. Signifying "dog" in the curly braces
			would mean that dogma would appear as dogma, but dog would appear as "***". Thus your censor list may appear
			as: cat {dog} boy.<br>
			<br>
			Do not use quotation marks and make sure you use curly braces, not parentheses, when specifying exact
			words.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Exempt Moderators From Censor</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Do you want to exempt your forum Moderators from the censor words? You will want to set this to yes if you
			censor anything that is part of a moderator's title like 'moderator' as they have custom titles by default
			and will get censored.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Number of friends to display in the small friends block</strong><br>
			The maximum number of friends to display in the Small Friends Block on the User Profile Page.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Friends Per Page on Full Friends List</strong><br>
			The maximum number of friends to show "per page" on the large friends list.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Maximum Visitors to Show on Profile Page</strong><br>
			Set an upper limit for the number of recent visitors to display. Recent visitor records are cleaned out on a
			regular basis, so keep this to a reasonably small number. Somewhere between 5 to 30 is ideal.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Show Last Post on Profile Page</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			When enabled, this option displays a user’s last post on their profile. <br>
			<br>
			This can increase table locking due to large table scans. It may also increase load times on your site as
			well as the load of your server. This option should only be enabled for smaller forums.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow Users to Edit Profile Privacy</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			This allows users to configure their profile page so that blocks and categories are shown or hidden to
			specific visitors.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Signature Soft-Linebreak Character Limit</strong><br>
			When counting the number of lines in a signature, this setting controls the number of characters that can be
			displayed before text wraps in the browser and is displayed as multiple lines. Once this value is surpassed,
			the run of text will be counted as multiple lines.<br>
			<br>
			The value in this setting should be based on the number of normal-sized characters. Other sized characters
			will be scaled appropriately to this setting.<br>
			<br>
			Allow Users to 'Ignore' Moderators (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			This allows users to add moderators and administrators to their ignore list. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow Signatures</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			This allows users to include a signature in their replies.
