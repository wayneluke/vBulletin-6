			To get to the <strong>Merge Users</strong> panel, click on the following in the menu to your left: <span
				class="Mprocess">Users &gt; Merge Users</span>.<br>
			<br>
			You can use the <strong>Merge Users</strong> panel to merge two users’ accounts into one (if, for example,
			one user registered twice).<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			Enter the username of the source user into the <strong>Source Username</strong> field. This user's data (as
			specified below) will be written over to the destination user. Permissions will not be transferred.<br>
			<br>
			Enter the username of the destination user into the <strong>Destination Username</strong> field. This user
			will inherit the source user's data. They will not inherit any permissions from the source user.<br>
			<br>
			Posts, threads, calendar events, and private messages of the source user will be changed to appear to have
			come from the destination user. The source user’s post count, reputation, buddies, and ignored users will be
			added to the destination user.<br>
			<br>
			Permissions will not be changed and moderator status will not be transferred; these must be
			re-specified.<br>
			<br>
			After merging the users, the source username will be available to be registered by another user after the
			time period specified by <strong>Username Reuse Delay</strong> setting in the <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/item_name" class="Mhop">User Registration Options</a>
			panel.
