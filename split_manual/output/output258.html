			To modify, edit and manage existing profile fields on the User Profile form, click on the following to your
			left: <span class="Mprocess">User Profile Fields-&gt;User Profile Field Manager</span>.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>User Profile Field Manager</strong><br>
			<br>
			The <strong>User Profile Field Manager</strong> panel allows you to manage and modify existing profile
			fields on the <strong>User Profile</strong> form.<br>
			<br>
			The table displays the Title, Options, Name, Display Order and links to modify the fields in the User
			Profile form.<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Title</strong> column displays the text entered into the <strong>Title</strong> field in
					the <strong>Add New User Profile Field</strong> form.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Options</strong> column displays any of the following options that are active for the
					field:<ul>
						<li><strong>Required</strong> - If the field is set as any of the <em>yes</em> options in the
							<strong>Field Required</strong> field on the in the <strong>Add New User Profile
								Field</strong> form.</li>
						<li><strong>Editable</strong> - If the field is set to <em>Yes</em> in the <strong>Field
								Editable by User</strong> field on the in the <strong>Add New User Profile
								Field</strong> form.</li>
						<li><strong>Private</strong> - If the field is set to <em>Yes</em> in the <strong>Private
								Field</strong> radio button option on the in the <strong>Add New User Profile
								Field</strong> form.</li>
						<li><strong>Searchable</strong> - If the field is set to <em>Yes</em> in the <strong>Field
								Searchable on Members List</strong> radio button option on the in the <strong>Add New
								User Profile Field</strong> form.</li>
						<li><strong>Member List</strong> - If the field is set to <em>Yes</em> in the <strong>Show on
								Members List</strong> radio button option on the in the <strong>Add New User Profile
								Field</strong> form.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The <strong>Name</strong> column displays the field number of the corresponding profile field. You
					can use a profile field's field number to make it show in user posts.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Display Order</strong> column shows the display order of the corresponding profile
					field. Display orders are used to order profile fields on the various pages of the User CP on which
					they can be displayed. You can change display orders by editing the display order fields and
					clicking the <strong>Save Display Order</strong> button.<div class="Mnote">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save Display Order</strong> for changes to
							the display order to take effect.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>The <strong>Controls</strong> column displays two links: one to edit and one to delete the
					corresponding profile field.<br>
					<br>
					Clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> link will display the options for the field, much like
					<strong>Add New User Profile Field</strong> form. There are a few differences that are discussed
					below.<br>
					<br>
					Clicking the <strong>Delete</strong> link displays a confirmation screen asking if you are sure you
					want to delete the field. Clicking the <strong>No</strong> button will cancel the operation and
					return you to the <strong>User Profile Field Manager</strong>. Clicking the <strong>Yes</strong>
					button will delete the field and all data associated with it. This action cannot be undone.</li>
			</ul><strong>Editing User Profile Fields</strong><br>
			<br>
			There are a couple points that you must consider when modifying an existing profile field.<br>
			<br>
			The first is that profile fields are limited in what other field types that they can be converted to.<ul>
				<li>A <strong>Single-Line Text Box</strong> can be converted to a <strong>Multiple-Line Text
						Box</strong> and vice versa</li>
				<li>A <strong>Multiple-Selection Checkbox</strong> can be converted to a <strong>Multiple-Selection
						Menu</strong> and vice versa</li>
			</ul>No other conversions are supported.<br>
			<br>
			Secondly, a special form is required when modifying the user choices in the <strong>Multiple-Selection
				Checkbox</strong> and <strong>Multiple-Selection Menu</strong> fields. If you wish to add, delete or
			change the order of the available options, click the <strong>Modify</strong> button in the
			<strong>Fields</strong> field of the form. It will display the following screen:<br>
			<br>
			To move an item up in the list, press the up arrow to the left of the item and to move an item down press
			the down arrow to the left of the item.<br>
			<br>
			To rename an item, click the <strong>Rename</strong> link to the right of the item. To delete an item, click
			the <strong>Delete</strong> link.<br>
			<br>
			Use the <strong>Add</strong> form to add a new item. To add a new choice to the list, enter the name of the
			choice in the <strong>Name</strong> field. You can set the position of the item using the
			<strong>Position</strong> dropdown menu. Click the <strong>Add New Option</strong> button to save the item
			to the list or click the <strong>Reset</strong> button to clear the form.
