			As of vBulletin there are two configuration files. There is the new vBulletin presentation config.php file,
			and the core configuration file. We will first go over the legacy configuration file as it contains your
			database information. The legacy configuration file is always located in the upload/core/includes/ folder of
			your vBulletin package.<div class="Mwarn">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Before uploading the vBulletin files to your web server, you must edit both
					vBulletin configuration files to tell vBulletin how to communicate with your database and server.
				</div>
			</div>To edit the configuration files, you will need to open the file in a text editor such as WindowsÂ®
			WordPad or another recommended editor.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Please use a <a

						class="Mhop">recommended editor</a> to avoid issues with the formatting and display of the file.
					PHP files are standard ASCII/ANSI plain text files and should not be saved as UTF-8 with BOM.</div>

			The vBulletin configuration files are in PHP. However if you follow these instructions, knowledge of PHP is
			not required to edit these files. The files are a series of variables. When setting a variable, you enter
			the value to the right of the equal sign. If the value is text rather than numbers it needs to be in single
			quotation marks. <br>
			<br>
			When making changes to the file, the edit should always be to the right of the = sign between the single
			quotes. For example:<br>
			<br>
			Default: $config['admincpdir'] = 'admincp'; <br>
			Correct: $config['admincpdir'] = 'myadmin'; <br>
			Incorrect: $config['myadmin'] = 'admincp';<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Make sure that you edit the info to the right of the equal sign. Do <strong>not</strong> edit the names in
			the brackets to the left of the equal sign. <br>
