			vBulletin users can belong to multiple usergroups. Assigning a user to more than one usergroup is a way to
			create a unique set of permissions for the user.<br>
			<br>
			For example, you might have a user who belongs to group X, but needs to have access to the few extra options
			(such as attaching files to posts) given by group Y. You can make X this user’s primary group and make Y a
			secondary group.<br>
			<br>
			If a user is in multiple usergroups that have conflicting permission settings, the “greater” permission
			overrides the “lesser.” A Yes always overrides a No, and a larger number overrides a smaller one.<div

				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Be careful when you put a user in a secondary group that you also use as a
					primary group. You might edit the group and inadvertently give the secondary user more permissions
					than you originally meant to!</div>
