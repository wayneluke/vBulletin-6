			To get to the <strong>Search IP Addresses</strong> panel, click on the following to your left: <span

			used.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;&lt;screenshot of Search IP Addresses form&gt;&gt;&gt;<ul>
				<li><strong>Find Users by IP Address</strong><br>
					If you wish to see what users have posted from a specific IP address, enter the address in this
					field. You may also enter a partial IP. For example, if you wish to see what users have had
					192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255, then enter 192.168.1. (Note the period after the final 1.)</li>
				<li><strong>Find IP Addresses for user</strong><br>
					If you wish to see what IP addresses a specific user has posted with, enter the username in this
					field.</li>
				<li><strong>Depth to Search</strong><br>
					A depth setting of 1 will only return the results of the specified search. A depth setting of 2 will
					return the results of the specified search, as well as running a search on each of the results. <br>
					<br>
					For example, a search on 127.0.0.1 with a depth of 1 returns "Freddie" and "Scott". A search on
					127.0.0.1 with a depth setting of 2 returns "Freddie" and "Scott", as well as returning all of the
					ip addresses used by "Freddie" and "Scott".</li>
