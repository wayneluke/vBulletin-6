			Path to Tags: <span class="Mprocess">Tagging &gt; Tags</span>.<br>
			<br>
			A tag is a metadata keyword or term string attached to a content item. Once the tag is attached, it can be
			used in a search for content.<br>
			<br>
			vBulletin tagging allows users to apply their own keywords (tags) to most content types. This allows users
			to categorize items based on their actual content.<br>
			<br>
			Tags can contain any character except a comma, which is used to separate multiple tags. Additionally, you
			cannot add tags with the following characteristics.<ul>
				<li>Have less than an administrator-specified number of characters. The default is 3.</li>
				<li>Have over 25 characters. (This is the default value. You can change it with the "Tag Maximum Length"
					option.)</li>
				<li>Contain any censored words.</li>
				<li>Are in a list of common words that you create yourself.</li>
			</ul>This page allows you to manage the existing tags:<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			By default, tags are shown alphabetically and paginated. If you want to see which tags have been added
			recently, you can click the <strong>Display Newest</strong> link.<br>
			<br>
			Below this, you can add a new tag or control synonyms:<br>
			<br>
			To add a new tag, type it into the text box and click <strong>Save</strong>.<br>
			<br>
			You can manipulate synonyms by checking one or more tags in the tag list and then using the pulldown list to
			select one of:<ul>
				<li>Merge Selected as Synonyms</li>
				<li>Promote Synonyms to Tags</li>
				<li>Delete Selected</li>
			</ul>If you merge selected tags as synonyms, the tags will be merged with the new tag that you specify. The
			old tags will be considered synonyms of the new tag. Any content associations for the affected tags will be
			updated to use the new tag and synonyms will automatically replaced by the main tag when they are added to
			content items in the future. If the new tag does not already exist, it will be created.
