			<strong>How to limit access until <em>x</em> posts made:</strong><br>
			<br>
			As with <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_permissions_tools_promotions_examples1"
				class="Mhop">Example 1</a>, some admins prefer to limit the access that a new user has until they
			‘prove’ themselves. This can be used for the following purposes (note these are not exhaustive):<br>
			<br>
			- Avatar size (or ability to have one!)<br>
			- Signature usage (ability to have or limit what can be used)<br>
			- Ability to use Blogs<br>
			- Access to specific Channels<br>
			<br>
			For this example, we will use the following criteria:<br>
			<br>
			- Initial Usergroup: <em>Registered Users</em><br>
			- ‘Full Member’ Usergroup: <em>Full Members</em><br>
			- Number of Posts before Promotion: <em>10</em><br>
			<br>
			As all new users go into the Registered Users usergroup by default, simply adjust the permissions for this
			group to what you wish them to have. Then, you need to setup the usergroup for those members who will have
			full access. To do this, create a new usergroup based off the Registered Users usergroup and set the
			permissions to give them the enhanced level of access.<br>
			<br>
			For more information on usergroups and permissions, please see <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_usergroup_permissions" class="Mhop">this section of
				the manual</a> relating to these.<br>
			<br>
			Once you have your usergroups setup to your needs, you should create the appropriate Promotion. Using the
			criteria above, your Promotions screen should look like this:<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;&lt;Screenshot of Promotions screen with the following criteria&gt;&gt;&gt;
				</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			Explanation:<ul>
				<li><strong>Usergroup</strong><br>
					This is the usergroup that the users are currently a member of, i.e. Registered Users. The Promotion
					will only apply to these users.</li>
				<li><strong>Posts</strong><br>
					These are the number of posts that a user should have made before they can be promoted, in this case
					10.</li>
				<li><strong>Promotion Strategy</strong><br>
					As this example will have a user promoted after 10 posts have been made, this should be set to
					‘Posts’</li>
				<li><strong>Promotion Type</strong><br>
					Set this option to ‘Primary Usergroup’. When the Promotions Scheduled Task runs, the user will then
					have their Primary Usergroup changed.</li>
				<li><strong>Move User to Usergroup</strong><br>
					This should be set to the new usergroup that was setup earlier, i.e. Full Members’</li>
			</ul>Note that the ‘Reputation Level’ and ‘Days Registered’ values although completed will have no effect on
			this Promotion as the Strategy has been set to ‘Posts’. Once the above have been set, click the
			<strong>Save</strong> button. <br>
			<br>
			Now complete, this Promotion will move active users from the ‘Registered Users’ usergroup to the ‘Approved
			Members’ usergroup once they have made 10 posts in your forum.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">To promote users using other criteria, simply set the relevant ‘Days
					Registered’ value, or ‘Reputation Level’ if promoting users after they receive ‘<em>x</em>’
					reputation points and set the ‘Promotion Strategy’ to the appropriate option.</div>
