			Avatars are small pictures that appear next to or underneath your members' names on their posts etc.<br>
			<br>
			Using the <strong>Avatar Manager</strong>, you can pre-define groups of avatars from which your members can
			choose one as their own avatar.<br>
			<br>
			Also under this section is a tool to control the storage of your members' custom avatars (those which they
			have uploaded themselves). You may choose to store custom avatars in the database, or as files on the
			server's file system.
