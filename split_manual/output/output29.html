			After you have successfully downloaded the vBulletin package to your computer you will need to prepare the
			scripts to be uploaded to your web server. We’ve included the instructions for both Windows 7® and Mac OS X®
			below.<br>
			<br>
			<font size="3"><strong>Windows 7®</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			The first thing to do is to decompress the package into its constituent files. If you’ve downloaded the
			<em>.zip</em> package and your computer is running a recent operating system, you should have all the tools
			you need to do this.<br>
			<br>
			To extract the files from the package, open the folder on your computer where you saved the vBulletin
			package and right-click on its icon. Choose <strong>Extract All...</strong> from the pop-up menu.<br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/extract.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			This will open a wizard to guide you through the unzipping progress. Accept the default options and the
			system will decompress the files from the zip package.<br>

			When the unzipping progress is complete, you will find that the process has created a new folder called
			<strong>upload</strong> and another called <strong>do_not_upload</strong>.<ul>
				<li>The <strong>upload</strong> folder contains the vBulletin files that need to be uploaded to your web
					server.<br>
					<br>
					Rename the <strong>upload</strong> folder to match the name you gave to the directory containing
					your vBulletin files on your web server. In this example, the folder containing the vBulletin files
					is called <strong>forums</strong>.<div class="Mnote">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">If you installed vB5 directly in the root directory of your web
							publishing folder (not in a subfolder), you do not need to rename the
							<strong>upload</strong> folder.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="Mnote">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">If you have changed the names of the <strong>admincp</strong> and
							<strong>modcp</strong> directories in your config.php file, be sure to make the same change
							to these subdirectories prior to uploading.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>The <strong>do_not_upload</strong> folder contains tools to perform various updating tasks on your
					board.<ul>
						<li><strong>searchindex.php</strong> - This file rebuilds the default vBulletin search index.
						</li>
						<li><strong>vb_backup.sh</strong> - This file allows you to run a database backup via SSH/Telnet
							or a scheduled backup through cron.</li>
						<li><strong>tools.php</strong> - This file must be uploaded to the <strong>admincp</strong>
							folder and allows you to perform certain tasks should your board go down or you accidentally
							lock yourself out of the <strong>Admin Control Panel</strong>.<div class="Mwarn">
								<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
								<div class="Mnotewarninner">Because this file presents a SEVERE security risk, it should
									be deleted immediately after use.</div>
							</div>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">As you already have a vBulletin installation running on your web server, you
					should delete the <strong>install.php</strong> file in the <strong>/core/install directory</strong>
					before you proceed to upload the files.</div>
