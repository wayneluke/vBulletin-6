			If you need to inform your members of some news, or otherwise want to post something important on your site,
			you can post it as an announcement.<br>
			<br>
			Announcements differ from threads in that they can appear in multiple forums simultaneously, and have a time
			period in which they are visible, then they disappear from view.<br>
			<br>
			When there are multiple announcements posted at the same time, the latest one is listed on the top.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a screenshot of one or more announcements.&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			You manage announcements from the Announcement Manager, which is accessible from the Announcements menu in
			the Admin CP.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;&lt;Insert a level setting screenshot of the initial page of the Announcement
					Manager.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
