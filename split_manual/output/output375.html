			Securing or "Hardening" your server is beyond the scope of this document but is an important step to
			creating a secure environment for your data. <br>
			Most hosting providers will provide this service if you have a dedicated machine so you should work with
			them to make sure your machine is as secure as possible. Below are some links that will help you. <br>
