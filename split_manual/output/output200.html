			To get to the <strong>User Banning Options</strong> panel, click on the following to your left: <span
				class="Mprocess">Settings &gt; Options &gt; User Banning Options</span>.<br>
			<br>
			This section of the Admin Control Panel allows you to set the banning options for your forum, including IP
			bans.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Enable Banning Options</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
					Banning allows you to stop certain IP addresses and email addresses from registering and posting to
					the forum.</li>
				<li><strong>Banned IP Addresses</strong><br>
					Use this option to prevent certain IP addresses from accessing any part of your board.<br>
					<br>
					If you enter a complete IP address (242.21.11.7), only that IP will be banned.<br>
					If you enter a partial IP (243.21.11. or 243.21.11), any IPs that begin with the partial IP will be
					banned. For example, banning 243.21.11 will prevent 243.21.11.7 from accessing your board. However,
					243.21.115.7 would still be able to access your board.<br>
					<br>
					You may also use an '*' as a wildcard for increased flexibility. For example, if you enter
					243.21.11*, many IPs will be banned including: 243.21.11.7, 243.21.115.7, 243.21.119.225.<div
						class="Mwarn">
						<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
						<div class="Mnotewarninner">Use this option with caution. Entering an incorrect IP can result in
							banning yourself or other genuine users from your forums.</div>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Banned Email Addresses</strong><br>
					You may ban any email addresses from registering and posting. Type in the complete email address
					(user@example.com), or use a partial email address (as in @example.com).<br>
					<br>
					Note that partial email addresses are matched from the <em>end</em> of the address unless you enable
					<strong>Aggressive Email Banning</strong> (see below). Therefore if you ban '@example.com' you will
					ban 'user@example.com', but if you ban '@example' that user will <em>not</em> be banned. If you
					enable <strong>Aggressive Email Banning</strong>, 'user@example.com' would be banned by
					'@example'.<br>
					<br>
					If the email address of a user attempting to register or change their email address matches any of
					the addresses you specify here will see a no-permission error. For example, if you have banned
					'example.com' then a user attempting to use 'someone@example.com' will be rejected.</li>
				<li><strong>Aggressive Email Banning</strong> (Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
					If this option is enabled, incomplete addresses are matched anywhere in the email address when
					checking for banned emails, not just the end.<br>
					<br>
					For example, if this option is enabled 'yahoo' will block any email address with 'yahoo' in it. If
					this option is disabled, no emails will be banned unless the ban was changed to 'yahoo.com'.</li>
				<li><strong>Allow User to Keep Banned Email Addresses</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
					If you ban an email address and a user already uses that address, a problem will occur. Using this
					option, you can specify whether the user will have to enter a new email address in their profile
					when they next modify their email address, or whether the user can just keep the email address which
					you have banned.</li>
				<li><strong>Global Ignore</strong><br>
					This option allows you to effectively add a user or users to every member's 'Ignore List'. However,
					users in this list can still see their own posts and threads.<br>
					<br>
					Enter a list of userid numbers into the textbox, separated by spaces (for example: 4 12 68 102).<div
