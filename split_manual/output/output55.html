				<font size="3">Using the Color Style Form</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			In vBulletin you can change the look of a page (the colors of the font, background and links) with the use
			of Styles. The Color Style Form makes it simple to create a Style for a page at the same time that you’re
			creating the page itself. To get to the Color Style Form in the Site Builder, make sure the option has been
			turned on. <br>
			<br>
			Depending on whether you’re editing or creating a new page, click on either the <strong>New Page</strong> or
			<strong>Edit Page</strong> button. <br>
			<br>
			<div align="center"><img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/color-style.png" border="0" alt=""></div>
			<br>
			Once the form drops down from the menu, click on the <strong>Color Style</strong> tab. This will open a form
			with a color wheel and a preview of the page with your chosen colors beneath the form. There are several
			different ways to use the form. Rather than walking you through an example of how to Style your page, we’ll
			go through the options and give you a detailed outline of what each does.<br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;Image here of form w/ color wheel and numbered options. Numbers must be added to the corresponding
			options&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			The color wheel is a quick way to change the colors of the page. The color palette is a preview of the
			colored elements on the page.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Color Wheel</strong> <br>
			There are two dots (1a and 1ab) on the Color Wheel. They control the color palette. 1a controls the primary
			color of your palette while 1b controls the secondary colors of your palette. The further apart they are,
			the more contrast your palette will have. The closer together they are, the more complementary the colors.
			To change the color palette, click and drag either dot around the color wheel. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Hue</strong><br>
			Clicking on <strong>Hue</strong> opens a pop up form with a text field. Entering a number between 0 and 360
			selects the primary color (dot 1a) for your color palette.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Angle</strong><br>
			Clicking on <strong>Angle</strong> opens a pop up form with a text field. Entering a number between 0 and
			360 selects the secondary color (dot 1b) and changes the palette. <br>
			<br>
			<strong>Hex</strong><br>
			Clicking on <strong>Hex</strong> opens a pop up form with a text field. Entering a hexadecimal code changes
			the primary color (dot 1a) for your color palette. <br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;Image here of form w/ My Color Palette and numbered options. Numbers must be added to the
			corresponding options&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Undo</strong><br>
			The <strong>Undo</strong> button undoes the last action taken.<br>
			<strong>Redo</strong><br>
			The <strong>Redo</strong> button redoes the last action that was undone.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>My Color Palette</strong><br>
			My Color Palette previews the colors for specific elements of the page. The preview of the color is followed
			by a list of elements it affects. Clicking on the preview opens the ‘Fine Tune Colors’ menu to the right for
			the selected element. <br>
			<br>
			&lt;&lt;Image here of form w/ Fine Tune Colors and numbered options. Numbers must be added to the
			corresponding options&gt;&gt;<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Fine Tune Colors</strong><br>
			This controls the shade of the individual element. Use the selector to the right of the preview square to
			choose the desired color. To change the selected element, click on the name of the element to be
			changed.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Fine Tune Colors</strong> also has four different templates to select from. These templates change
			the defaults for the overall look of the page and eliminate the possibility of customizing certain elements.
			Here’s a complete list of those options:<ul>
				<li><strong>Color</strong> - template that uses the selected colors</li>
				<li><strong>White</strong> - template that makes everything white except for the following elements:
					Background, Font Color, Navigation Background, and Navlink Text</li>
				<li><strong>Grey</strong> - template that makes everything grey except for the following elements:
					Background,Category Description</li>
				<li><strong>Dark</strong> - template that makes everything black except for the following elements:
					Background,Category Description</li>
