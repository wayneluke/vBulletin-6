			Path to Permission Duplication Tools: <span class="Mprocess">User Groups &gt; Channel Permissions</span>,
			then click on <strong>Permission Duplication Tools</strong>.<br>
			<br>
			This page allows you to duplicate existing permissions, either by usergroup or by channel. This expedites
			setting up a usergroup or channel that is similar to an existing one.<br>
			<br>
			The usergroup-based permission duplicator copies permissions from a usergroup into one or more other
			usergroups you select. You can limit this to specific channels with the Only Copy Permissions from channel
			option. <br>
			<br>
			To prevent accidental overwriting, use the Overwrite Duplicate Entries and Overwrite Inherited Entries
			settings. Overwrite Duplicate Entries prevents you from overwriting an existing permissions set for a
			channel (the entries are in red) for one of the usergroups you are copying to. Overwrite Inherited Entries
			is similar, except that it refers to cases where permissions arenâ€™t directly specified for a channel, but
			rather a parent channel (the entries are in orange).<br>
			<br>
			Click the <strong>Go</strong> button to execute the permission copy. <br>
			<br>
			Click the <strong>Reset</strong> button to clear any checkboxes you have checked.<br>
			<br>
			The channel-based permission duplicator works in a similar fashion, except that it copies all permissions in
			one channel to one or more selected channels. Overwrite Duplicate Entries and Overwrite Inherited Entries
			behave the same way.
