			Path to Adding or Editing a Language: <span class="Mprocess">Languages &amp; Phrases &gt; Language
				Manager</span> and click <span class="Mbutton" title="Click the &#39;Add New Language&#39; button">[Add

			</strong><br>
			<br>
			The form to add or edit a language contains many settings that are specific to a locale. For example, some
			people might prefer the mm/dd/yy date format, while others prefer dd/mm/yy.<br>
			<br>
			<font size="2"><strong>General Settings</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			<strong>Title</strong><br>
			Name of the language. The title is displayed to users when they are selecting a language.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Allow User Selection</strong> (<u>Yes</u>/No)<br>
			Whether or not users can select the language. If this is set to No, the language is effectively
			disabled.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Text Direction</strong> (default: Left to Right)<br>
			Direction of the text in the language. For example, English is left to right, while Hebrew is right to
			left.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Language Code</strong> (default: en)<br>
			Two-character, standard abbreviation for the language (for example, fr for French)<br>
			<br>
			This value does not have any effect on the displayed text, but it may be used by programs such as screen
			readers.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>HTML Character Set</strong> (default: ISO-8859-1)<br>
			This indicates the encoding of the characters that are displayed on the page. Setting this to an incorrect
			value might prevent some characters from being displayed. If you are unsure what to put here, enter <span
				class="Mtype">UTF-8</span>, as it will likely contain the characters you need.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Image Folder Override</strong><br>
			The path to button images, relative to the main channel directory, that contains translated text. This
			replaces the button images folder, which defaults to images/buttons. If you want to specify a specific
			button directory for each style, you can use <span class="Mtype">&lt;#&gt;</span>. At runtime, this replaces
			the ID number of the style that the user is using.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Date / Time Formatting</strong><br>
			Date and time specification.<br>
			<br>
			Settings in this group allow you to override the default date and time formatting with one that is more
			appropriate for your language. For example, <em>English (US)</em> would use the mm/dd/yy format, while
			<em>English (UK)</em> would use the dd/mm/yy format. These formats are represented by <span
				class="Mtype">%m/%d/%y</span> and <span class="Mtype">%d/%m/%y</span>, respectively.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Locale</strong><br>
			You can define a locale or just specify the correct date and time formats in the settings below. Since
			locales are not supported on all systems, it is better to manually specify the correct date and time formats
			if you can.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Date Format Override</strong><br>
			Overrides the date format specified in your vBulletin options. Leave blank to use the format that is set in
			your vBulletin options.<br>

			your vBulletin options.<br>

			<strong>Registration Date Format Override</strong><br>
			Overrides the registration date format specified in your vBulletin options. Leave blank to use the format
			that is set in your vBulletin options.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Birthday Date Format Override (with year)</strong><br>
			Overrides the birthday with year format that is specified in your vBulletin options. Leave blank to use the
			format that is set in your vBulletin options.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Birthday Date Format Override (without year)</strong><br>
			This setting will override the birthday without year format that is specified in your vBulletin options.
			Leave blank to use the format that is set in your vBulletin options.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Log Date Format Override</strong><br>
