			When a new version of vBulletin is released, it is common for some of the default <a
				href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/languages_manage_phrase" class="Mhop">phrases</a> to have
			been updated to accommodate new features or fix bugs.<br>
			<br>
			If you have not customized any of your phrases, this need not concern you, but if you <em>have</em>
			customized some of the default phrases, there are a few steps you will need to follow after you have
			finished running all the appropriate upgrade scripts.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">When running vBulletin upgrade scripts, one of the final steps imports the
					newest version of the default phrases.<br>
					<br>
					Any phrases that you have <em>not</em> customized will automatically be updated to use the newest
					versions.<br>
					<br>
					However, any phrases that you have customized <strong>will not</strong> be altered or overwritten by
					importing the latest phrases, hence the need for the following steps.</div>
