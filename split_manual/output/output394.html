			With MySQL installed and ready to store information, all that's left is to get the server running on your
			computer. While you can run the server as the root user, or even as yourself (if, for example, you installed
			the server in your own home directory), the best idea is to set up a special user on the system that can do
			nothing but run the MySQL server. This will remove any possibility of someone using the MySQL server as a
			way to break into the rest of your system. To create a special MySQL user, you'll need to log in as root and
			type the following commands:<blockquote class="Mtype">/usr/sbin/groupadd mysqlgrp<br>
				/usr/sbin/useradd -g mysqlgrp mysqlusr</blockquote>By default, MySQL stores all database information in
			the var subdirectory of the directory to which it was installed. We want to make it so that nobody can
			access that directory except our new MySQL user. The following commands will do this (I'm assuming you
			installed MySQL to the /usr/local/mysql directory):<blockquote class="Mtype">cd /usr/local/mysql<br>
				chown -R mysqlusr.mysqlgrp var<br>
				chmod -R go-rwx var</blockquote>
