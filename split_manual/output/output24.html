			After a few pages the installation process will complete, and you will be presented with a link to your
			Admin Control Panel. Before clicking this link, you should open up your FTP client application again and
			browse to the <strong>/core/install</strong> folder inside your forums directory.<p class="Mfig"><img

			all files and subdirectories here as a security precaution. Doing so will not impact vBulletin's operation
			on your site. Once you have deleted these files you can return to the installer script and click the link to
			enter the Administrator Control Panel of your freshly installed vBulletin!<br>
