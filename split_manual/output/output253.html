			your left: <span class="Mprocess">User Profile Fields&gt; Add New User Profile Field</span> then select
			<strong>Single-Selection Menu</strong> from the dropdown menu.<br>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Title</strong><br>
					The name of your Single-Selection Menu field.</li>
				<li><strong>Description</strong><br>
					This is the description of the field as shown to your users. You should describe here what the field
					is intended for, and if it is required field or not, and/or if it is private from other users or
					not.</li>
				<li><strong>Profile Field Category</strong><br>
					It is possible to group custom user profile fields into categories so that they can be logically
					grouped. The primary purpose of doing this is to allow different categories to be shown in different
					tabs or blocks on a user's profile page (in addition to being shown in the 'About Me' tab). See the
					<a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/acp_userprofilefields_userprofilefieldcategories"
						class="Mhop">User Profile Field Categories</a> article for more information.</li>

					with a new line carriage return ("Enter" key).</li>
				<li><strong>Set Default</strong> <em>Default: Yes, Including a First Blank Item</em>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>None</strong><br>
							The selected option will be a blank field. If you require this field, this will force the
							user to make a choice.</li>
						<li><strong>Yes, Including a First Blank Option</strong><br>
							This sets the first option above as selected but also creates a blank option allowing the
							user to choose nothing if this field isn't required.</li>
						<li><strong>Yes, but No First Blank Option</strong><br>
							This also sets the first option above as selected but doesn't allow the user to choose a
							nothing since their is no empty option to choose from.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Display Order</strong><br>
					This sets the order in which fields are displayed. The default is to add it to the end of your
					current fields. Display order starts at 1 and can be any whole positive number (don't use decimals
					or fractions).</li>
				<li><strong>Field Required</strong> <em>Default: No</em>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Yes, at registration and profile updating</strong><br>
							User will be required to complete this field at registration and when updating their
							profile.</li>
						<li><strong>Yes, always</strong><br>
							User will be required to complete this field at registration. Enabling this setting will
							force all users to complete it before they can continue using your forum. This applies only
							if the field is shown on the "Edit Your Details" page.</li>
						<li><strong>No</strong><br>
							Completion of this field is optional.</li>
						<li><strong>No, but display at registration</strong><br>
							Completion of this field is optional but it will appear at registration.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Field Editable by User</strong> <em>Default: Yes</em>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Yes</strong><br>
							User may edit this field at any time.</li>
						<li><strong>No</strong><br>
							User may never edit this field.</li>
						<li><strong>Only at registration</strong><br>

							blank.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Private Field</strong> <em>Default: No</em><br>
					If this is set to <em>Yes</em>, this field can be filled in by the user but will only be viewable to
					those with the proper usergroup permission.</li>
				<li><strong>Field Searchable on Members List</strong> <em>Default: Yes</em><br>
					If this is set to <em>No</em>, users will not be able to search using this field on the
					<strong>Member's List Advanced Search</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Show on Members List</strong> <em>Default: Yes</em><br>
					If this is set to <em>Yes</em>, this field will be displayed on the <strong>Member's List</strong>
					for each user.</li>
			</ul><strong>Optional Input</strong><br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">&lt;&lt;&lt;Screenshot of Optional Input section&gt;&gt;&gt;</font>
			</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Allow user to input their own value for this option</strong> <em>Default: No</em><br>
					If this is set to <em>Yes</em>, the user will be allowed to fill in a text input field as an
					alternative to the options you have given for this field.</li>
				<li><strong>Max length of allowed user input</strong> <em>Default: 100</em><br>
					The maximum number of characters that the member will be allowed to input.</li>
				<li><strong>Field Length</strong> <em>Default: 25</em><br>
					The width of the input box in characters.</li>
				<li><strong>Regular Expression</strong><br>
					You may require this field's contents to match a PCRE-type regular expression. For example, you
					could have a field that is for the user's ICQ number. Since ICQ numbers consist of only numerals,
					you could write a regular expression to check for non-numerals.<br>
					<br>
					Example:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
						<pre class="Mcodeblock">^[0-9]{7,8}$</pre>
					</div>If you want to allow an empty response to be given, you need to account for it within the
					regex:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
						<pre class="Mcodeblock">^[0-9]{7,8}$|^$</pre>
					</div>See <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php" target="_blank">PHP.net</a>
					for more information on regular expressions.<br>
				</li>
			</ul><strong>Display Page</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Which page displays this option?</strong> <em>Default: Edit Profile</em><br>
					This controls what page the profile field is displayed on. Most likely you want to leave this on
					"Edit Profile" but if you wish to create your own user options that can be manipulated via template
					conditionals then select "Options". This field will then appear on the "Options" page of the User
					CP. Also, this field will not appear when viewing a user's profile.</li>
