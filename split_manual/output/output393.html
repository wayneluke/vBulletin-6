			With the program downloaded, you should make sure you're logged in as <em>root</em> before proceeding with
			the installation, unless you only want to install MySQL in your own home directory. Begin by unpacking the
			downloaded file and moving into the directory that is created:<blockquote class="Mtype">tar xfz
				mysql-version.tar.gz<br>
				cd mysql-version</blockquote>Next you need to configure the MySQL install. Unless you really know what
			you're doing, all you should have to do is tell it where to install. I recommend /usr/local/mysql:
			<blockquote class="Mtype">./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql</blockquote>After sitting through the
			screens and screens of configuration tests, you'll eventually get back to a command prompt. You're ready to
			compile MySQL:<blockquote class="Mtype">make</blockquote>After even more screens of compilation, you'll
			again be returned to the command prompt. You're now ready to install your newly compiled program:<blockquote
				class="Mtype">make install</blockquote>MySQL is now installed, but before it can do anything useful its
			database files need to be installed too. Still in the directory you installed from, type the following
			command:<blockquote class="Mtype">scripts/mysql_install_db</blockquote>With that done, you can delete the
			directory you've been working in, which just contains all the source files and temporary installation files.
			If you ever need to reinstall, you can just re-extract the mysql-version.tar.gz file.
