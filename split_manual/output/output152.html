			Path to Download / Upload Languages: <span class="Mprocess">Languages &amp; Phrases &gt; Download / Upload
				Languages</span>.<br>
			<br>
			In vBulletin you can download (export) and upload (import) languages like you do styles. This capability
			allows you to share your translations with others or use existing translations to save you time.<br>
			<br>
			The download/upload functionality is part of the Language Manager. There are two forms: Download, and Import
			Language XML File.<br>
			<br>

			<strong>Filename</strong><br>
			Name of the language file. We recommend including a string representing the name of the language in the file

			<font size="2"><strong>Import Language XML File Options</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			<strong>EITHER upload the XML file from your computer</strong><br>
			File path to the file on your computer. If you leave this blank, the Language Manager assumes that you want
			to import the file from your server.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>OR import the XML file from your server</strong><br>
			Enter a file name complete with a server path that is relative to your main site directory.<br>
			<br>
			For example, if the name of the language file is vbulletin-language.xml and you uploaded it to the install
			directory inside your main site directory, then the value you would enter is
			./install/vbulletin-language.xml.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Overwrite Language</strong><br>
			If you want to overwrite an existing language with the file you are uploading, select it from the picklist.
			Otherwise make sure (Create New Language) is selected.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Title for Uploaded Language</strong><br>
			Name of the language as it appears on the site. If you are overwriting a language, that language will be
			renamed with this title; otherwise, your new language will be named with this title.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Ignore Language Version</strong> (default: Yes/<u>No</u>)<br>
			Whether or not to use the language even if it was created by a different version of vBulletin.<div
				class="Mwarn">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Language data generally changes from version to version. If you are
