			With vBulletin, you can run the upgrade script from the command line and remove the overhead of your browser
			and HTTP calls. The command line interface is designed to specifically help big boards with the upgrade
			process and to eliminate the time caused by HTTP interaction. <br>
			<br>
			To run this interface, go to your install directory
			(<em>http://www.yourdomain.com/pathtoforums/core/install/upgrade.php</em>) using the ‘cd’ command and
			execute:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">php -f upgrade.php
</pre>
			</div>If you are logged in as the root user, you will need to run the upgrade as the user that the webserver
			runs under. This will prevent permission problems from occurring later if you store CSS as files. Use this
			command:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">sudo -u &lt;user&gt; php -f upgrade.php
</pre>
			</div>Where &lt;user&gt; is the user that the webserver is run with. On most systems, this is the user
			nobody.<br>
			<br>
			Your CLI version of PHP may not have been compiled with or configured to use the same modules as your web
			version. If you encounter problems in command line mode, switching to the web mode should be able to process
			through them. You can see your command line configuration by typing:<div class="Mcodecontainer">
				<pre class="Mcodeblock">php -i &gt; phpinfo.txt
</pre>
			</div>You can then review the output in any text editor. You should inspect this configuration to make sure
			that it has mysql and/or mysqli available so you can connect to the database. You would also need to make
			sure that the command line version of PHP has XML support. If it does not, then you would need to run the
			XML imports from the Browser.
