			Announcements provide you with a way to distribute news and updates to your users. Announcements can be
			site-wide or channel-specific.<br>

			Each announcement displays its title, the user who created it, edit/delete controls, and its display time
			frame (how long it will be active).<br>
			<br>
			The title of each announcement is displayed above the channel threads for as long as the announcement is
			active.<br>
