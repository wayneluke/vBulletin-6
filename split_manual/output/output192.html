			Although membership in multiple groups is a good way to create exceptions to rules set up by usergroup
			permissions, they might be too powerful for some situations. For cases where you simply want to give a
			specific user access to a forum that he or she wouldn’t normally have access to, an alternative solution is
			access masks, which override all forum-level usergroup permissions.<div class="Mwarn">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Warning:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">Access mask settings have no effect unless you have enabled access masks in
					vBulletin Options.</div>

				<div class="Mnotewarninner">You must click <strong>Save</strong> for changes to take effect.</div>
			</div>To edit the access masks assigned to a specific user, go to <span class="Mprocess">Users &gt; Search
				for Users</span>. Then search for the user you want to edit and click <strong>Edit Forum
				Permissions</strong> or <strong>Edit Access Masks</strong>.<br>
			<br>
			To view existing access masks, go to <span class="Mprocess">Users &gt; Access Masks</span>.<br>

			Access masks work similarly to forum-level usergroup permissions: inheritance to child forums still occurs.
			However, you do not have as many options as with a forum permission:<ul>
				<li>Setting a user’s access mask to Yes for a forum gives him or her the same permissions in that forum
					as he or she has at the global level, regardless of any forum-level usergroup permissions specified.
				</li>
				<li>Setting the mask to No denies the user access to the forum completely, as if each individual
					permission were set to No.</li>
				<li><em>Default</em> means that no special access mask is specified; forum-level usergroup permissions
					are used instead.</li>
			</ul>
