			<font size="3"><strong>Channel Manager</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			The <strong>Channel Manager</strong>, accessible via <span class="Mprocess">Channel Management&gt; Channel
				Manager</span>, is where you can choose to do a portion of your channel management. This is in addition
			to the management that you can do through the <strong>Site Builder</strong> function. Unlike the
			<strong>Site Builder</strong>, the <strong>Channel Manager</strong> gives you an overview of all the
			Channels in a central location. <br>
			<br>
			When you enter this section, you will be presented with a screen similar to this:<br>
			<br>
			<img src="./vBulletin Manual_files/channel-manager.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
			<br>
			<font size="2"><strong>Forum</strong></font><br>
			Each row in the table is a channel in the database. In the first column, <strong>Title</strong>, you will
			see the name of the forum; clicking the name will allow you to edit the forum’s information. <br>
			<br>
			<font size="2"><strong>Controls</strong></font><br>
			The dropdown list in the next column of the <strong>Channel Manager</strong> has several options and will
			take you to other parts of vBulletin. The following is a list of the options and what they do:<ul>
				<li><strong>Edit Forum</strong> - this takes you to a page where you can edit each of the selected
					channel’s settings. </li>
				<li><strong>View Forum</strong> - this displays the channel on the front end, allowing you to see the
					information posted to it.</li>
				<li><strong>Delete Forum</strong> - this allows you to remove the channel from the database. If this
					channel has any sub-channels, they will also be removed.</li>
				<li><strong>Add Child Forum</strong> - this takes you to the Add New Forum page with this forum
					automatically selected as the new forum’s parent.</li>
				<li><strong>Add Moderator</strong> - this allows you to specify a new moderator for this channel.</li>
				<li><strong>Add Announcement</strong> - this allows you to create a new announcement to be displayed at
					the top of the selected channel.</li>
				<li><strong>View Permissions</strong> - this displays the Channel Permissions Manager and scrolls to the
					selected channel.</li>
			</ul>
			<font size="2"><strong>Display Order</strong></font><br>
			This controls the order in which the channels are displayed.<br>
			<br>
			<font size="2"><strong>Moderators</strong></font><br>
			The options in this dropdown list allow you to view and add moderators for a channel.<ul>
				<li><strong>Moderators (x)</strong> – this simply displays the number of moderators for this forum. It
					is not a clickable link.</li>
				<li><strong>Add Moderators</strong> – this opens a form for you to add new moderators to the channel.
				</li>
			</ul>
