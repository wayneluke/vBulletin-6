			If you have downloaded a vBulletin XML style file from another vBulletin installation, or if you want to
			restore a style backup that you made yourself, you will have need of the vBulletin Style Importer.<br>
			<br>
			This system will read an XML file, convert the data inside it into StyleVars, CSS, Replacement Variables and
			Templates and write the data into your database.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>
				<font color="red">***SCREENSHOT OF UPLOAD OPTIONS PAGE***</font>
			</strong><br>
			<br>
			The Style Download form is relatively simple, with the following controls:<ul>
				<li><strong>Either Upload XML File from your computer</strong><br>
					If the XML style file you want to import is located on your own computer, press the ‘Browse’ button
					and use the popup navigator to find the file and upload it.</li>
				<li><strong>Or Import XML file from your server</strong><br>
					If the XML style file you want to import is located on your web server, enter the file path to the
					file here. This should be the path relative to the directory where vBulletin is installed.</li>
				<li><strong>Merge Into Style</strong><br>
					If you are restoring a style backup, you will probably want to import the XML file over the top of
					the style of which it is a backup. To do this, select the style you want to merge into from the list
					provided. If no style is chosen from the list, a new style will be created and the data in the XML
					file will be imported into this new style.</li>
				<li><strong>Ignore Style Version</strong><br>
					When a style file is downloaded from vBulletin, the version number of the vBulletin exporting the
					file is included. If the version number included in the style file you are importing does not match
					the version number of the vBulletin doing the import a warning will be shown to alert you to
					possible incompatibilities. If you are confident that no errors will occur as a result of importing
					a style from a different version of vBulletin, use this control to force vBulletin to accept the
					file regardless of the stored version number.</li>
				<li><strong>Title for Uploaded Style</strong><br>
					If you chose to create a new style rather than overwrite an existing style, vBulletin will use the
					style title included in the XML file as the title for the new style unless you specify an
					alternative title using this control.</li>
				<li><strong>Parent Style</strong><br>
					When importing a style as a new style, this allows you to set whether the newly imported style
					should be a parent style or the child of another style. Select the option you wish from the
					dropdown.</li>
				<li><strong>Display Order</strong><br>
					This text box expects you to enter a whole number (0, 15, 99, 1007 etc) to affect the position at
					which this style will appear in any style lists. It corresponds to the display order text box on the
					main <a href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/stylemanager" class="Mhop">Style Manager</a>
					interface.</li>
				<li><strong>Title for Uploaded Style</strong><br>
					This Yes/No choice corresponds to the checkbox next to each style on the main <a
						href="https://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/main/stylemanager" class="Mhop">Style Manager</a>
					interface, and affects whether or not your visitors will be able to use this style to view the
					board.</li>
			</ul>Once you have entered your selections in the form, press the <strong>[Import]</strong> button to import
			your style customisations into your database.<div class="Mnote">
				<div class="Mnotewarnheader">Note:</div>
				<div class="Mnotewarninner">XML style files can not contain image files, so no images will be imported
					when using this system. If the style you are importing requires special images, you will need to
					upload them to your web server using an FTP client.</div>
