			CP:<ul>
				<li>General infraction</li>
				<li>Per-post infraction</li>
			</ul>To see a user’s list of infractions (current and historical), go to the user’s profile and locate the
			Infractions form, which shows a summary and allows you to add infractions.<br>
			<br>

			To give an infraction for a particular offending reply, click the <strong>Yellow Card / Red Card</strong>
			icon. (The location of the icon varies depending on your Postbit layout and style.) <br>
