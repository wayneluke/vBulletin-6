			<strong>Anti-Spam Service</strong> (default: Disable Scanning)<br>
			Controls the service that is used for scanning supported data. You must enter the corresponding API key for
			the service (either <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> or <a
				href="http://antispam.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Typepad Anti-spam</a>).<br>
			<br>
			<strong>vBulletin Anti-Spam Key</strong><br>
			Enter a vBulletin Anti-Spam service key (which you obtain from the service selected in the Anti-Spam Service
			option) to enable scanning of user data where supported.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Spam Scanning Post Threshold</strong> (default: 0)<br>
			This setting controls how many of a user's posts are scanned by the Anti-Spam Service. Once a user's post
			count exceeds this threshold, his or her posts are not scanned for spam content. <br>
			<br>
			To always scan posts set this value to 0.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Anti-Spam Data Storage Length (Days)</strong> (default: 7)<br>
			Whenever a post is made, extra anti-spam data is stored. This allows details about false positives and false
			negatives to be submitted to the chosen anti-spam system to improve it.<br>
			<br>
			This value specifies the length of time (in days) for which this data is stored.
