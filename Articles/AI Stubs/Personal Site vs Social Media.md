Personal Site vs Social Media

The Case for a Personal Community Website

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a big part of many people's lives. These sites make it easy to connect with friends, family, and followers from all over the world. However, there are some downsides to relying too heavily on social media. Developing your own personal community website can be a great alternative for more meaningful connections.

Control Over Your Content & Community

On a personal website that you build and host yourself, you have complete control and ownership over your content. You don't have to worry about a third party controlling or censoring what you post or limiting your reach. You also get to decide who participates in your community, rather than algorithms determining what people see. This level of control and flexibility is very difficult to achieve on most social platforms today.

Focus More on Depth of Relationships

Social media tends to prioritize breadth of connections over depth. It's easy to accumulate friends and followers, but harder to cultivate meaningful back-and-forth interactions. With a personal community site, you can better focus on relationships with those who truly matter to you instead of chasing likes and comments. For example, you may want to build a members-only community of close friends and family.

Avoid Toxicity & Misinformation  

The combination of algorithms, anonymity, misinformation campaigns, and lack of moderation makes it very difficult to escape negativity on some social platforms. Building your own healthy online community allows you to set norms and moderate effectively right from the start. You can create a supportive space for constructive dialogue.

Showcase Your Whole Self & Interests

Social media often skews perceptions of others because you only see select snippets. A members site allows you to showcase more facets of your personality and life. Through blog posts, you can share substantial ideas and stories over time, not just ephemeral social media posts. You can also highlight creative projects and professional accomplishments.

In summary, taking the time to develop your own online home and community provides more ownership and allows you to focus on depth over breadth in your connections with others. The result can be more fulfilling relationships with less toxicity. Though it takes more effort than just signing up for existing platforms, a personal site brings major long-term benefits.
