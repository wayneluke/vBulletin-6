# web-based community design:

## Introduction

Web-based communities have become an integral part of the online landscape. Communities allow people to gather in virtual spaces to discuss common interests, share ideas and experiences, and form connections. However, creating an engaging online community takes thoughtful planning and design. Community managers and website developers must consider the purpose, target audience, features, policies, and long-term sustainability when conceiving an online community.

## Defining Goals and Purpose

The first step in designing a web-based community is defining its purpose and goals. Is the community focused on networking professionals in a certain industry or nurturing a hobbyist group? Is it meant to facilitate support between people facing common challenges or bringing together fans of a sports team? Having a clear vision of who the community is meant to serve and what role it will play for members provides crucial direction for all other design choices.  

It also allows community leaders to define success metrics and track growth. Generic vanity metrics like number of users or posts offer limited useful information. More meaningful metrics based on core goals reveal whether the community is truly thriving. For instance, an online health support group may track whether users report feeling less alone in their struggles.

## Understanding Your Target Audience

A thoughtfully designed web community tailored to serve a specific audience has the best chance of attracting and retaining members. Start by researching the potential member base to discern factors like:

- Demographic information such as age, location, gender identity 
- Psychographic features including values, interests, priorities
- What challenges they face or goals they aspire to achieve
- What online platforms and tools they currently use
- What frustrations do they have with existing options

These insights should inform key decisions around features, tone and policies. For example, a community aiming to empower young professionals may adopt an inspirational tone, provide career-building resources, and create spaces for networking.

Community leaders should continue gathering member feedback once the community launches and be ready to tweak the design to better meet audience needs. Consistently putting user value first helps foster belonging.

## Selecting Features and Functionality
The features and functionality that provide the framework for how members will interact depends on a community’s purpose and audience. Most web-based communities incorporate some blend of:

- Discussion forums: The backbone of many online communities where members exchange posts about shared topics of interest. Features like upvoting surface popular content.  
- Private messaging: Enables one-on-one communication between members to share information privately or deepen relationships.
- Multimedia sharing: Photos, videos, audio files bring discussions to life.
- Profiles: Help members share information on their background and interests and find like-minded members.
- Groups: Smaller subgroups unite members with particular commonalities.
- Events: Online or in-person gatherings keep the community active and engaged.  

A niche community united by a specific identity, interest or goal may also incorporate unique features like member directories, marketplaces, wikis and leaderboards catered to their purpose.  

## Establishing Community Guidelines

Clear community guidelines set standards for respectful conduct and constructive exchanges between members. Guidelines typically:
  
- Prohibit harassment, threats, hate speech and other behavior that marginalizes groups
- Ban illegal activities and content
- Limit spam and self-promotion
- Encourage productive debates and civil disagreement
- Instruct members how to flag concerning content for review

Ideally, guidelines should be co-developed with input from a sample of target members. This helps create standards aligned with member values and norms. Once published, they provide crucial guidance as the community grows.

Content Moderation Approach
Careful forethought must inform the approach to content moderation, or how leaders will enforce community guidelines. Key considerations include:
  
- Deciding whether to pre-moderate content before it’s visible to members or use a “respond after the fact” model
- Determining if volunteer moderators from the community or paid staff will review flagged posts
- Crafting detailed protocols for issuing warnings, temporary suspensions or permanent bans over guideline violations  

A heavy-handed, reactive approach risks constraining discussion. But an overly lenient model enables abuse. Leaders should be transparent about policies and open to reevaluating them based on member feedback.

Cultivating Ongoing Engagement
Even a thoughtfully designed, well-managed community fails without enough participating members regularly contributing value. thus community leaders should incorporate ongoing engagement strategies. Examples include:

- Sending regular newsletter or digest emails recapping recent activity
- Featuring “member spotlights” to celebrate active contributors
- Hosting “ask me anything” (AMA) sessions with special guests
- Facilitating collaborative projects members can collectively contribute towards
- Curating “best of” posts to showcase community impact

Leaders should track metrics like number of daily or monthly active commenters and time spent per member to gauge participation rates. Consistently delivering value to members pays dividends in the form of their sustained attention and involvement.  

## Planning for Sustainability

Creating an online community calls for sizable upfront and ongoing investments of time, money and labor. Thus leaders must factor long-term sustainability from the outset by considering potential monetization models. Some options include:

- Subscription fees granting access to certain content or features
- Advertising networks offering relevant promotions members may appreciate
- Community partnerships and affiliate programs rewarding member activity
- Branded merchandise displaying community pride
- Premium memberships with extra functionality or visibility

Ideally, monetization strategies preserve the user experience. Leaders should ensure any sponsors or advertisers align with community values too.

Transparency and governance are also key for sustainability. Public reporting on finances, decision-making policies and moderator guidelines builds community trust. And establishing processes for members to provide input prevents stagnation.  

A member-centric foundation provides the bedrock for web communities to keep meeting the evolving needs of participants over months, years or decades.

## Conclusion

Online communities can wield immense power to inform, empower and nurture meaningful connections between people worldwide. But simple technical know-how is not enough to develop one; deliberate design choices rooted in understanding both purpose and audience make the difference between short-lived message boards and thriving hubs with lasting impact. From defining goals to selecting features, crafting guidelines to sustainability models, community architects must consider many interlocking pieces. The communities most likely to stand the test of time always put their members first.
