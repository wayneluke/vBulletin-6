Driving Participation: Strategies to Get Community Forum Members More Active

For owners and moderators of online community forums, attracting an initial surge of members is only the first step to success. Keeping members actively posting, commenting and liking content over the long-term requires dedicated effort. 

Lurking vs Participating 

A common challenge forums face is “lurkers” - members who frequently visit and read content but rarely contribute any posts or comments themselves. The lurker-to-contributor ratio often exceeds 90/10. While lurkers add value through page views, the lifeblood keeping forums vibrant and useful comes from those sharing questions, insights and experiences. Without that member-generated new material, old threads go stale and site traffic eventually declines.

Defining Your Goals

The first step to jumpstarting member participation is clearly defining goals and metrics for engagement. Consider setting specific objectives around:

• New discussions started weekly/monthly
• Number of comments per discussion 
• Percentage of members posting per month 
• Average visits per member per week/month

Tracking stats starting from the forums’ launch establishes your baseline. Once you implement participation-building strategies, monitoring the numbers shows their impact.

Fostering an Engaging Environment  

Making sure your community delivers the value and experience members seek is foundational to participation. Start by surveying both active and less involved members about what they currently like as well as what frustrations or barriers they face to contributing more. 

Common suggestions for improvements include more dynamic discussions of interest, mobile-friendly interfaces, faster moderation of inappropriate content, and notification options. 

Feedback may also call for more or less strict posting policies - some members want virtually no moderation while others prefer strict rules against off-topic posts. Finding the right balance requires regularly checking in with your audience.   

Equipping Members to Participate

Assuming members know how to effectively participate in forum discussions is a risky move. Savvy forums offer clear instructions and FAQs explaining best practices like:  

• How to start a new thread, comment on a post, upvote contributions
• Tips for writing clear thread titles and descriptions 
• Guidance on objectively responding to others’ opinions and experiences
  
Consider hosting live webinars walking new members through using main features. Maintain an updated online manual with visuals too.  

Role modeling matters as well - if moderators consistently post thoughtful contributions following guidelines, members will emulate that behavior.  

Motivation Building 

Beyond a supporting platform, members participate more when motivated by individual and community advances. Gamification, recognition programs and goal setting are key tactics.  

Gamification refers to applying game design elements into online communities to drive engagement. For instance, members could gain “XP” points for activities like starting discussions, commenting, referring new members or hitting “like” thresholds. Points accumulate to boost their public profile badge or ranking.  

To recognize standout contributors, forums can feature a “Member of the Month” chosen by mods and admins. Or publicly thank top referrers and posters. 

Setting group objectives, like hitting a target number of new weekly posts, also mobilizes members. These goals feel more achievable through collective effort. Broadcast progress towards goals to motivate participation.  

Offsite Events

Online communities transitioning into hosting local “real world” events is a proven way to strengthen member loyalty and activity. For instance, members of a nutrition forum could meet up for cooking classes focused on different diets they discuss online.  

Other examples include book clubs, volunteer activities, attending sports matches or concerts, bar meetups and more. These in-person gatherings allow members to interact face-to-face instead of just online. 

Polls help admins choose events based on members’ interests and availability. Leverage photos from meetups to promote the community and inspire others to participate both offline and on your forums.

Staying Member-Focused

Keeping members and their needs central to all decisions around forum features, policies, events and more maintains participation momentum. Regular user surveys, focus groups and open communication channels help align plans with audience priorities.

Rather than chasing trendy forum features a tiny subset may use, focus on incrementally improving aspects benefiting the majority. Stay attuned to feedback through polls, email comments or forums pointing to what’s working versus what causes frustration. 

Upholding respectful community standards and expectations around constructive dialogue is also key to avoiding loss of valuable members due to harassment or negativity. Monitor flags and complaints closely - if issues escalate, revisit rules or procedures.  

Commit for the Long Haul 

Building a vibrant forum with active member participation is a gradual process requiring vision, empathy and adaptability from administrators. Set realistic growth targets while laying cultural foundations valuing each member’s perspective and needs. Maintain transparency around goals and challenges so members feel invested in shaping the community’s path too.

Stay focused on incrementally improving member experiences through features and events rather than quick superficial fixes unlikely to increase lasting participation. Consistent member engagement both enriches the community and ensures its longevity.
