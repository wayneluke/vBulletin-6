Developer tools can be accessed by pressing F12 in most browsers. In MacOS Safari, you have to turn on the Developer Menu in the preferences and then press ⌥⌘i to open the Web Inspector. You will probably have to refresh the page (F5 on Windows/Linux, ⌘r on MacOS) to see any output.  
  
Diagnostic tools can be limited on smartphones and tablets.
