# vBulletin 6.0.1 Changes and Updates

## Front End Changes

### Who Reacted

Users can now see who reacted to a post by hovering or long-pressing the reaction on the post. A popup will list everyone who reacted.

## One-Click Unsubscribe

Outgoing content notifications emails will now contain a "One-Click Unsubscribe" link. This will take the user to a page that unsubscribes them from the topic or channel. If the user is subscribed to parent channels, they can remove those subscriptions as well. If the parent channel subscriptions are left intact, they will continue to receive notifications for all descendant channels.
